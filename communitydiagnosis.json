    "explanation": "Assets-based assessment is a strength-centered approach that focuses on what a community has, rather than what it lacks. It empowers communities to take ownership by building on existing resources like people, institutions, networks, and traditions. This contrasts with needs-based approaches that emphasize deficits.",
    "additional": "Comparison:\nNeeds-Based → Focus: Problems. View: Deficits. Outcome: Dependency.\nAssets-Based → Focus: Strengths. View: Resources. Outcome: Empowerment.\n\nPractical Example:\nInstead of saying 'youth lack opportunities', an assets-based view asks 'what skills, mentors, and spaces already exist that we can build on?'\n\nFuture Question Idea: \"What approach begins with the question: 'What are our community’s strengths?'\" (Answer: Assets-based assessment)"

    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Community participation emphasizes the active involvement of people in the decisions that affect their health. It builds trust, improves program relevance, and supports sustainability. When communities help identify and solve their own health problems, interventions are more accepted and effective.",

    "explanation": "This question defines a critical part of a community health assessment: looking for inequality.\n\nHealth Disparities (or Health Inequities): A particular type of health difference that is closely linked with social, economic, and/or environmental disadvantage. Health disparities adversely affect groups of people who have systematically experienced greater obstacles to health based on their racial or ethnic group; religion; socioeconomic status; gender; age; mental health; disability; sexual orientation; or geographic location.\n\nPrimary Focus of Analysis: It's not enough to know the overall health status of a community. A good diagnosis disaggregates the data—it breaks it down by different population subgroups (e.g., by income, by ethnicity, by geographic area) to see if some groups are faring worse than others. This analysis pinpoints where the greatest needs are and where interventions should be targeted to promote health equity.",

    "explanation": "The World Health Organization (WHO) bases the diagnosis of leprosy on the presence of at least one of its three cardinal signs. Option A (a skin patch with a definite loss of sensation) is a primary cardinal sign and often the first one detected.\n\nOption B (Presence of leprosy bacilli) is confirmed through a lab test called a slit-skin smear, which supports the diagnosis but is not always required to start treatment, especially in resource-limited settings.\n\nOption C (General fatigue and loss of appetite) are non-specific symptoms that can be present in many illnesses and are not diagnostic for leprosy.\n\nOption D (One or more enlarged peripheral nerves) is another cardinal sign, but the skin lesion with sensory loss is the most classic and frequently identified sign.",
    "additional": "Causative Agent: Mycobacterium leprae\n\nTransmission: Primarily through respiratory droplets from untreated multibacillary patients.\n\nCardinal Signs:\n- Skin lesion with sensory loss\n- Enlarged peripheral nerves\n- Positive slit-skin smear\n\nTypes:\n- Paucibacillary: 1–5 lesions, 6 months MDT (Rifampicin + Dapsone)\n- Multibacillary: >5 lesions or nerve involvement, 12 months MDT (Rifampicin + Dapsone + Clofazimine)\n\nBook Tag: K.
