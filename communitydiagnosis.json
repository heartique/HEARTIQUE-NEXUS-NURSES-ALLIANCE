    "d": "The nurse needs no special precautions, but the client is instructed to cover his/her mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing."
  },
  "answer": "c",
  "explanation": "Why (c) is correct: Active pulmonary Tuberculosis (TB) is spread via the airborne route. Tiny droplet nuclei containing Mycobacterium tuberculosis are expelled when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks, and they can remain suspended in the air for long periods. Therefore, Airborne Precautions are required. The cornerstone of airborne precautions for healthcare workers is wearing a specially fitted N95 or HEPA respirator to filter these small particles. Hand hygiene is a fundamental component of all precautions (Standard Precautions) and should always be performed.\n\nWhy (a) is wrong: Hand washing alone is part of Standard Precautions but is insufficient to protect against inhaling airborne pathogens.\n\nWhy (b) is wrong: A gown and gloves are components of Contact Precautions. They are used to prevent the spread of pathogens through direct or indirect contact (e.g., C. difficile, MRSA). While they might be necessary if contact with bodily fluids is anticipated, they do not protect the respiratory system and are not the primary, mandatory precaution for entering the room of a patient with active TB.\n\nWhy (d) is wrong: This is dangerously incorrect. Active TB requires stringent infection control measures to protect healthcare workers and other patients. Instructing the client on respiratory etiquette is important but is not a substitute for the nurse's use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).",
  "additional": "Isolation Room: The ideal room for a patient with active TB is an Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR), which is a single-patient room under negative pressure. This means air flows from the hallway into the room, preventing infectious particles from flowing out. The air from the room is then exhausted directly to the outside or filtered through a HEPA filter.\n\nPatient Transport: If the patient must leave the room for essential procedures, they should wear a standard surgical mask to contain their respiratory secretions.\n\nDiagnosis: Diagnosis is confirmed with a positive sputum smear for Acid-Fast Bacilli (AFB) and subsequent culture or nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT).\n\nPossible content to be tested next IN NCK:\n\nPharmacology of TB: The side effects of first-line anti-TB drugs (RIPE):\n\nRifampicin: Causes orange/red discoloration of body fluids (urine, sweat, tears).\n\nIsoniazid (INH): Can cause peripheral neuropathy (prevented with Pyridoxine - Vitamin B6) and hepatotoxicity.\n\nPyrazinamide: Can cause hyperuricemia (gout) and hepatotoxicity.\n\nEthambutol: Can cause optic neuritis (impaired red-green color vision).\n\nPatient Education: The critical importance of adhering to the full 6-9 month medication regimen to prevent the development of Multidrug-Resistant TB (MDR-TB).\n\nLatent vs. Active TB: Differentiating between Latent TB Infection (LTBI - positive TST/IGRA, negative chest x-ray, asymptomatic, not infectious) and Active TB disease.\n\nBook Reference:\n\nBrunner & Suddarth's Textbook of Medical-Surgical Nursing\n\nKenya National Tuberculosis, Leprosy and Lung Disease Program (NTLD-P) Guidelines"

    "d": "Allow the child to play in the playroom until the health care provider can be contacted."
  },
  "answer": "b",
  "explanation": "Why (b) is correct: Varicella (Chickenpox) is a highly contagious disease transmitted via both airborne droplets and direct contact with vesicle fluid. The rash (exanthema) and exposure history strongly suggest an active infection. The most critical and immediate nursing action is to prevent transmission to other vulnerable patients. This requires implementing Strict Isolation, which includes both Airborne and Contact Precautions, and placing the child in a private, preferably negative-pressure, room.\n\nWhy (a) is wrong: Placing the child in \"any available bed\" (e.g., a semi-private room) would expose other patients to the virus, which is a major breach of infection control protocol.\n\nWhy (c) is wrong: While assessing the rash and reporting to the provider are important nursing actions, they are not the priority. The immediate priority is infection control and safety. You must isolate first to prevent spread, then perform your detailed assessment.\n\nWhy (d) is wrong: Allowing the child in a playroom is extremely dangerous as it would expose numerous other children, many of whom may be immunocompromised.

    "c": "Toxins released from trophozoites.",
    "d": "Sporozoites released from red blood cells and are rapidly being killed in the spleen."
  },
  "answer": "b",
  "explanation": "Why (b) is correct: The classic clinical feature of malaria is a paroxysm (sudden cycle) of chills, high fever, and sweating. This cycle corresponds directly to the life cycle of the Plasmodium parasite within the human host. During the erythrocytic stage, the parasites (merozoites) invade red blood cells (RBCs), multiply asexually, and eventually rupture the RBCs to release a new generation of merozoites. This synchronized rupture of millions of RBCs releases parasitic toxins and waste products, most notably hemozoin (a waste product from the digestion of hemoglobin). The body's immune system mounts a massive inflammatory response to these substances, leading to the characteristic fever and chills.\n\nWhy (a) is wrong: Gametocytes are the sexual stages of the parasite that are picked up by a mosquito; their destruction does not cause the acute fever cycle.\n\nWhy (c) is wrong: While toxins are released, the specific trigger is the massive, synchronized release during RBC rupture, not a continuous release from individual trophozoites (the growing stage inside the RBC). The key is the rupture event.\n\nWhy (d) is wrong: Sporozoites are the form injected by the mosquito. They travel to the liver, not the red blood cells, to begin the first stage of infection (exo-erythrocytic stage). Merozoites, not sporozoites, are released from RBCs.",
  "additional": "The Malarial Paroxysm Stages:\n\nCold Stage (15-60 mins): Intense feeling of cold, vigorous shivering.\n\nHot Stage (2-6 hours): High fever (can exceed 40°C), flushed dry skin, headache.\n\nSweating Stage (2-4 hours): Profuse sweating, declining temperature, exhaustion.\n\nPeriodicity: The time between fever cycles depends on the Plasmodium species: 48 hours for P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale (tertian malaria) and 72 hours for P. malariae (quartan malaria).\n\nSevere Malaria: P. falciparum is the most dangerous species and can cause severe complications like cerebral malaria, severe anemia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\n\nPossible content to be tested next IN NCK:\n\nAntimalarial Drugs: The mechanism of action or key side effects of drugs like Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies (ACTs), Chloroquine, and Quinine (e.g., Cinchonism).\n\nMalaria Prophylaxis: Patient education on chemoprophylaxis for travelers and preventive strategies like using insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and insect repellent.\n\nDiagnosis: The gold standard for diagnosis is microscopic examination of thick and thin blood smears.

    "answer": "c",
    "explanation": "Why (c) is correct: A depressed immune system (immunocompromised state, e.g., from chemotherapy, high-dose steroid therapy, or a congenital immunodeficiency) is a true and absolute contraindication for administering live attenuated vaccines (e.g., MMR, Varicella, Rotavirus, live attenuated influenza vaccine [nasal spray]). Giving a live, albeit weakened, pathogen to a person who cannot mount an effective immune response can lead to a severe, disseminated, and potentially fatal infection from the vaccine virus itself. This is the most critical contraindication to assess for across a major class of vaccines.\n\nWhy (a) is wrong: Mild illness, such as a common cold with low-grade or no fever, is not a contraindication to vaccination. Delaying vaccines for minor illnesses can disrupt the schedule and leave children vulnerable. Vaccination should only be postponed for moderate-to-severe acute illness.\n\nWhy (b) is wrong: Chronic conditions like asthma are not a contraindication. In fact, individuals with chronic respiratory diseases are often prioritized for certain vaccines, like the annual influenza shot, to prevent complications.\n\nWhy (d) is wrong: An egg allergy is a specific precaution or contraindication for only certain vaccines that are prepared using chicken embryos, primarily the influenza vaccine and yellow fever vaccine. It is not a general contraindication for all immunizations. Therefore, a depressed immune system is a broader and more universally critical factor to assess.",
    "additional": "Contraindication vs. Precaution:\n\nContraindication: A condition in a recipient that greatly increases the chance of a serious adverse reaction. The vaccine should NOT be given.

The single most important and effective intervention to prevent the spread of enteric pathogens like Salmonella in a healthcare setting is meticulous hand hygiene. While other precautions are useful, hand washing is the fundamental, primary action that breaks the chain of transmission. It prevents the nurse from carrying the pathogen from the patient or their environment to themselves or other patients.\n\nWhy (b), (c), and (d) are wrong: These actions describe the use of gloves, which are part of Standard Precautions or Contact Precautions. Gloves are indeed essential when handling feces, vomit, or contaminated items. However, they are an adjunct to hand hygiene, not a replacement for it. The CDC emphasizes that even after removing gloves, hands must be washed because gloves can have microscopic tears or hands can become contaminated during glove removal. Therefore, hand washing is the more foundational and primary intervention.

  "explanation": "This question tests detailed knowledge of the Plasmodium life cycle, specifically the stages that occur within the mosquito vector.\n\nWhy (d) is correct: The sexual stage of the malaria parasite's life cycle occurs inside the mosquito. When a female Anopheles mosquito ingests blood from an infected human, it takes up male and female gametocytes. In the mosquito's midgut, these gametocytes mature and fuse (fertilization) to form a zygote. This zygote then develops into a motile, elongated form called an ookinete. The ookinete is the \"motile zygote,\" and its function is to penetrate the gut wall. Therefore, this stage is found in the gut of the female anopheles.\n\nWhy (a) and (b) are wrong: The human liver and red blood cells are sites of asexual reproduction (schizogony) in the human host. The liver stage involves sporozoites developing into merozoites, and the red blood cell stage involves merozoites multiplying and forming gametocytes. The zygote is a product of sexual reproduction, which does not occur in humans.\n\nWhy (c) is wrong: After the ookinete penetrates the gut wall and forms an oocyst, it multiplies and releases thousands of sporozoites.

      "C": "Salivary glands of female anopheles",
      "D": "The gut of female anopheles"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The life cycle of Plasmodium, the parasite that causes malaria, involves two hosts: humans and the female Anopheles mosquito. When a female Anopheles mosquito bites an infected human, it ingests gametocytes (the sexual form of the parasite) along with the blood. Inside the mosquito's gut, these gametocytes mature into male and female gametes, which then fuse to form a zygote. This zygote is initially non-motile but soon develops into a motile form called an ookinete. This motile zygote, or ookinete, then penetrates the wall of the mosquito's gut.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the other options:\nHuman liver: This is where sporozoites, injected by a mosquito bite, mature into merozoites.\nHuman red blood cells: Merozoites from the liver infect red blood cells, multiply asexually, and eventually develop into gametocytes.\nSalivary glands of female anopheles: After maturing in the mosquito's gut wall, the parasite (now as sporozoites) migrates to the mosquito's salivary glands, ready to be injected into a new human host.",
    "additional": "For the upcoming Nursing Council of Kenya (NCK) exams, it is crucial to have a comprehensive understanding of the Plasmodium life cycle:\nHuman Cycle (Asexual):\nInoculation: An infected female Anopheles mosquito injects sporozoites into the human bloodstream.\nHepatic (Liver) Stage: Sporozoites travel to the liver, invade liver cells, and multiply asexually to form thousands of merozoites. This is an asymptomatic phase. In some species (P. vivax and P. ovale), some parasites can remain dormant in the liver as hypnozoites, leading to relapses months or years later.\nErythrocytic (Blood) Stage: Merozoites are released from the liver, invade red blood cells, and multiply. This is the stage that causes the clinical symptoms of malaria. The parasites mature from a ring form to a trophozoite and then to a schizont, which ruptures to release more merozoites, leading to cyclical fevers.\nGametocytogenesis: Some merozoites differentiate into male and female gametocytes, which are the sexual stages of the parasite. These circulate in the blood, waiting to be ingested by a mosquito.\nMosquito Cycle (Sexual):\nIngestion: A mosquito ingests blood containing gametocytes.\nFertilization: In the mosquito's midgut, the gametocytes mature and fertilize to form a zygote.\nOokinete Formation: The zygote develops into a motile ookinete, which penetrates the midgut wall and forms an oocyst.\nSporogony: Inside the oocyst, thousands of sporozoites develop. The oocyst eventually ruptures, releasing the sporozoites into the mosquito's body cavity.\nMigration: The sporozoites migrate to the mosquito's salivary glands, completing the cycle.\nA possible NCK question could ask about the stage of the parasite responsible for clinical symptoms (merozoites rupturing red blood cells) or the stage responsible for relapse (P. vivax hypnozoites)."

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Ascaris lumbricoides, the giant human roundworm, is transmitted through the fecal-oral route. An infected person passes Ascaris eggs in their feces. In areas with poor sanitation, these eggs can contaminate soil, water, or food. For transmission to occur, a person must ingest the embryonated (infective) eggs. This commonly happens by consuming contaminated water or food, such as raw vegetables grown in contaminated soil, or through hands contaminated with soil.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the other options:\nMosquito bite: Transmits diseases like malaria, dengue fever, and filariasis.\nTse-tse fly: Transmits African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness).\nConsuming uncooked pork: Can transmit trichinellosis (Trichinella spiralis) and taeniasis (Taenia solium or pork tapeworm).",
    "additional": "For the NCK exam, it's important to understand the life cycle and public health implications of Ascaris lumbricoides:\nLife Cycle:\nIngestion: A person ingests infective eggs.\nHatching: The eggs hatch in the small intestine, releasing larvae.\nMigration: The larvae penetrate the intestinal wall and travel via the bloodstream to the liver and then to the lungs.\nMaturation in Lungs: In the lungs, the larvae mature over about 10-14 days, then ascend the bronchial tree to the throat and are swallowed.\nAdult Worms: Back in the small intestine, the larvae develop into adult male and female worms. The adult worms live in the small intestine and can grow up to 35 cm long. A female can produce approximately 200,000 eggs per day, which are passed in the feces.\nClinical Features:\nMost infections are asymptomatic.\nHeavy infections can cause abdominal pain, malnutrition, and even intestinal obstruction, especially in children.\nDuring the larval migration phase through the lungs, a patient might experience a cough, wheezing, or eosinophilic pneumonitis (Loeffler's syndrome).\nPrevention and Control: Key strategies include improving sanitation (proper disposal of feces), promoting handwashing, and washing raw fruits and vegetables thoroughly. Mass drug administration (MDA) with anthelmintic drugs like albendazole or mebendazole is a common public health intervention in endemic areas.\nA potential NCK question could focus on the public health measures to prevent ascariasis or the complications of heavy worm infestation."

    "additional": "For the NCK exam, be familiar with the different forms of plague and their transmission:\nForms of Plague:\nBubonic Plague: The most common form. It results from an infected flea bite. The bacteria travel to the nearest lymph node, causing it to become inflamed, tense, and painful. This is called a \"bubo.\" It is not typically transmitted from person to person.\nSepticemic Plague: Occurs when the infection spreads directly through the bloodstream without forming a bubo, or as a complication of untreated bubonic plague. It is characterized by fever, chills, extreme weakness, abdominal pain, shock, and possibly bleeding into the skin and other organs.\nPneumonic Plague: The most virulent and least common form. It can result from the inhalation of infectious droplets from another person with pneumonic plague or as a secondary spread from untreated bubonic or septicemic plague. It is the only form of plague that can be spread from person to person.\nPublic Health Importance: Plague is a serious public health concern due to its high mortality rate if left untreated.

    "explanation": "The classic clinical feature of malaria is a cyclical pattern of fever, chills, and sweating. This paroxysm is directly caused by events in the erythrocytic (red blood cell) stage of the parasite's life cycle. Inside the red blood cells, the parasites (merozoites) multiply asexually, developing into schizonts. When these schizonts mature, they rupture the red blood cell to release a new generation of merozoites that can infect other red blood cells. This rupture occurs synchronously (at the same time) for large numbers of infected cells. The simultaneous release of merozoites, parasitic toxins, and waste products, particularly a substance called hemozoin, triggers a massive inflammatory response from the host's immune system, resulting in the characteristic fever and chills.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the other options:\na.) Destruction of...gametocytes by...White Blood Cells: Gametocytes do not cause the acute febrile episodes. Their destruction would not lead to the classic malarial paroxysm.\nc.) Toxins released from trophozoites: While the parasite produces toxins, the key trigger for the fever spike is the synchronous rupture of the schizonts, not a continuous release from the trophozoite stage.\nd.) Sporozoites released from red blood cells...: Sporozoites are found in the liver stage, not the red blood cell stage. Merozoites are the form released from red blood cells.",
    "additional": "For the NCK exam, understanding the pathophysiology of malaria symptoms is vital for patient assessment and management.\n\nThe Malarial Paroxysm: The cycle of symptoms typically includes:\nCold Stage (15-60 minutes): The patient feels intensely cold and experiences shivering and rigors (chills).\nHot Stage (2-6 hours): The chills stop, and the patient's temperature rises sharply, often to 40°C (104°F) or higher.

The incubation period for varicella is typically 10 to 21 days. The presentation of a rash after this incubation period is highly suggestive of active chickenpox.\n\nVaricella is highly contagious and spreads through two routes:\nDirect contact with the fluid from the blisters.\nAirborne route via respiratory droplets.\n\nGiven the highly contagious and airborne nature of the virus, the immediate nursing priority is to prevent its spread to other, potentially susceptible, patients (especially those who are immunocompromised). This requires implementing both airborne and contact precautions. The first and most critical step is to isolate the child.\n\nHere's why other options are inappropriate:\n(A) Immediately admit the client to any available bed: This would expose other patients in a shared room to varicella.\n(C) Assess the progression of the...rash and report it...: While assessment and reporting are essential nursing actions, they are not the first priority. The immediate priority is infection control. Isolation should be initiated simultaneously with or even before a detailed assessment to prevent transmission.\n(D) Allow the child to play in the playroom...: This is extremely dangerous as it would expose numerous other children to the virus in a common area.\n\nTherefore, placing the child in a private room and initiating strict isolation (which includes airborne and contact precautions) is the most appropriate and immediate intervention.",
    "additional": "For the NCK exam, questions often test the nurse's ability to prioritize actions, particularly in infection control scenarios.\n\nKey Features of Varicella (Chickenpox):\nCausative Agent: Varicella-zoster virus (VZV).\nIncubation Period: 10-21 days.\nProdrome: May have mild fever and malaise 1-2 days before the rash.\nRash: The characteristic rash is pruritic (itchy) and progresses through distinct stages: macules -> papules -> vesicles (\"dewdrop on a rose petal\") -> pustules -> crusted-over scabs. A key feature is that lesions in all stages are present simultaneously. The rash typically starts on the trunk and face and spreads to the extremities.\nPeriod of Communicability: A person is contagious from 1-2 days before the rash appears until all lesions have crusted over.\n\nNursing Priorities for Varicella:\nInfection Control: Immediate implementation of airborne and contact precautions. Place patient in a negative-pressure room if available. Staff entering should wear an N95 respirator, gown, and gloves. Only staff with evidence of immunity to varicella should care for the patient.\n\nSymptom Management:\nItching (Pruritus): Keep fingernails short, provide cool baths (e.g., oatmeal bath), apply calamine lotion. Administer antihistamines as prescribed.\nFever: Administer non-aspirin antipyretics (e.g., paracetamol). Aspirin should never be given to children with viral illnesses due to the risk of Reye's syndrome.\n\nMonitoring for Complications: Secondary bacterial skin infections, pneumonia, and encephalitis are potential complications.\n\nA potential NCK question could ask about the characteristic appearance of the varicella rash, key patient education points (like avoiding aspirin), or identifying which staff member is appropriate to assign to a child with chickenpox (one who is vaccinated or has had the disease)."

    "question": "A nursing asks a nursing student to describe live or attenuated vaccines. What should the student tell the instructor about the types of vaccines.",
    "options": {
      "A": "Live attenuated vaccines contain bacterial toxins that have been made inactive by either chemicals or heat.",
      "B": "Live attenuated vaccines contain pathogens made inactive by either chemicals or heat.",
      "C": "Live attenuated vaccines have their virulence (potency) diminished so as not to produce a full-blown clinical illness.",
      "D": "Live attenuated vaccines have been obtained from the pooled blood of many people and provide antibodies to a variety."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This question assesses the fundamental understanding of how different types of vaccines work.\n\nLive attenuated vaccines use a version of the living virus or bacterium that has been weakened (attenuated) in a laboratory. Because it is still alive, the pathogen replicates in the body, but it is too weak to cause serious disease in people with healthy immune systems. This limited replication mimics a natural infection and induces a strong, often lifelong, immune response involving both antibodies and T-cells. Option (C) accurately describes this process.\n\nLet's break down why the other options are incorrect descriptions of live attenuated vaccines:\n(A) ...contain bacterial toxins that have been made inactive...: This describes a toxoid vaccine (e.g., tetanus, diphtheria).\n(B) ...contain pathogens made inactive...: This describes an inactivated (or killed) vaccine (e.g., inactivated polio vaccine, whole-cell pertussis). The pathogen is killed and cannot replicate.\n(D) ...obtained from the pooled blood of many people and provide antibodies...: This describes the administration of immunoglobulin or passive immunity, not a vaccine. It provides immediate but temporary protection by giving someone else's pre-made antibodies.",
    "additional": "For the NCK exam, you should be able to classify common vaccines and understand their mechanisms, advantages, and disadvantages.\n\nLive Attenuated Vaccines: Weakened (attenuated) living pathogen that replicates in the body. Examples: MMR (Measles, Mumps, Rubella), Varicella (Chickenpox), Rotavirus, BCG (Tuberculosis), Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV), Yellow Fever. Pros: Strong, long-lasting (often lifelong) immunity. Cons: Cannot be given to immunocompromised individuals or pregnant women. Rare risk of reverting to virulent form.\n\nInactivated (Killed) Vaccines: Pathogen is killed and cannot replicate. Examples: Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV), Hepatitis A, Rabies. Pros: Safe even in immunocompromised. Cons: Weaker response; requires boosters.\n\nToxoid Vaccines: Contain inactivated bacterial toxin. Examples: Tetanus, Diphtheria. Pros: Protects against toxins. Cons: Needs boosters.\n\nSubunit / Recombinant / Conjugate Vaccines: Contain only specific parts of the pathogen. Examples: Hepatitis B, HPV, Hib, Pneumococcal (PCV), Pertussis (in DTaP). Pros: Very safe. Can be used in immunocompromised. Cons: May need boosters.\n\nmRNA Vaccines: Contain messenger RNA that instructs cells to produce antigen. Examples: Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. Pros: Strong immune response. Cons: Newer tech; long-term data developing.\n\nA potential NCK question could ask you to identify which vaccine is contraindicated for a pregnant or immunocompromised patient (Answer: any live attenuated vaccine like MMR or Varicella) or to classify a specific vaccine like BCG or Hepatitis B."

    "question": "The nurse is planning care for a child with an infectious and communicable disease. The nurse should identify which as the primary goal.",
    "options": {
      "a": "The child will experience mild discomfort.",
      "b": "The public health department will be notified.",
      "c": "The child will not spread the infection to others.",
      "d": "The child will experience only minor complications."
    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
    "correct_answer_text": "The child will not spread the infection to others.",
    "explanation": "The most important goal in caring for a child with a communicable disease is to prevent the spread of infection to others. While symptom relief and notifying public health authorities are important, the immediate priority is to break the chain of transmission through isolation, proper hand hygiene, use of personal protective equipment, and education. This approach protects others in the healthcare environment and the broader community. Discomfort and complications are clinical concerns but secondary to containment. Similarly, notifying the public health department is a legal and procedural step, not a direct preventive action."

    "question": "A newborn infant receives the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine (Recombivax, HB, Engerix-B) within 12 hours of birth. The nurse instructs the mother regarding the immunization schedule for this vaccine and should tell the mother that the second vaccine is administered at which time period?",
    "options": {
      "a": "3 years of age and then during adolescent years.",
      "b": "8 months of age and then 1 year after the initial dose.",
      "c": "6 months of age and then 8 months after the initial dose.",
      "d": "1 to 2 months of age and then 6 months after the initial dose."
    },
    "correct_answer": "d",
    "correct_answer_text": "1 to 2 months of age and then 6 months after the initial dose.",
    "explanation": "The recommended hepatitis B immunization schedule involves three doses: a birth dose (within 12 hours of birth), a second dose at 1 to 2 months of age, and a third dose at 6 months. This schedule ensures effective development of immunity. In Kenya’s KEPI program, the birth dose is followed by doses at 6, 10, and 14 weeks, often combined in the pentavalent vaccine. The second and third doses in this format still align with the general timeline and immune system development milestones for infants."

    "question": "During the care of a client with salmonella infection, the primary limit transmission in these approaches?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Wash hands thoroughly before and after client contact.",
      "b": "Wear gloves when in contact with body secretions.",
      "c": "Double glove when in contact with feces or vomit.",
      "d": "Wear gloves when disposing of contaminated linens."
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "correct_answer_text": "Wash hands thoroughly before and after client contact.",
    "explanation": "Salmonella is transmitted via the fecal-oral route, making hand hygiene the most important prevention measure. Although gloves provide a protective barrier, they do not eliminate the need for handwashing, which is essential before and after glove use. Hands can become contaminated during glove removal or from touching contaminated surfaces. Handwashing directly interrupts the route of transmission by removing pathogens. Double gloving is not routinely required for salmonella, and gloves alone do not prevent all forms of contamination."

    "question": "The nurse is teaching a class on HIV prevention. Which of the following should be emphasized as increasing risk?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Donating blood.",
      "b": "Using public bathrooms.",
      "c": "Unprotected sex.",
      "d": "Touching a person with AIDS."
    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
    "correct_answer_text": "Unprotected sex.",
    "explanation": "Unprotected sexual activity is the primary mode of HIV transmission. HIV is spread through direct contact with infected body fluids such as semen, vaginal fluids, and blood during vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Donating blood does not pose a risk as sterile, single-use equipment is used. Using public bathrooms or casual physical contact like touching or hugging does not spread HIV. Clarifying this helps reduce stigma and corrects common misconceptions while emphasizing behaviors that carry real risk."

    "question": "Which contraindication should the nurse assess for prior to giving a child immunization?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Mild cold symptoms.",
      "b": "Chronic asthma.",
      "c": "Depressed immune system.",
      "d": "Allergy to eggs."
    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
    "correct_answer_text": "Depressed immune system.",
    "explanation": "A severely depressed immune system is a major contraindication for administering live vaccines, such as MMR, Varicella, or BCG. Live vaccines contain weakened pathogens that could cause illness in immunocompromised individuals. Conditions like cancer, HIV/AIDS, or treatment with immunosuppressive medications increase this risk. Mild illnesses like a cold or chronic conditions such as asthma are not contraindications. Egg allergy is now rarely considered a contraindication due to advances in vaccine formulations, especially with MMR and influenza vaccines."
