    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Sublingual nitroglycerin allows rapid absorption through capillaries under the tongue. This bypasses liver metabolism and provides fast relief for angina."
  },
  {
    "question": "A patient with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is prescribed ipratropium bromide inhaler. Which instruction should the nurse provide to the patient regarding ipratropium inhaler use?",

      "C": "Hold breath for 10 seconds after inhalation.",
      "D": "Rinse mouth after each use."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Holding the breath allows medication particles to settle in the lungs. This increases drug effectiveness by enhancing bronchial deposition."
  },
  {
    "question": "A patient with a history of heart failure is prescribed carvedilol. Which parameter should the nurse monitor closely during carvedilol therapy?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Blood glucose levels",

  },
  {
    "question": "A patient with a history of peptic ulcer disease is prescribed proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for ulcer healing. Which information is important for the nurse to include in patient education about PPI therapy?",
    "options": {
      "A": "PPIs should be taken on an empty stomach.",
      "B": "PPIs should be discontinued once symptoms resolve.",
      "C": "PPIs may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.",
      "D": "PPIs should be taken with antacids for optimal effect."
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Taking PPIs before meals allows drug absorption before proton pumps activate. This timing ensures maximum acid suppression during meals."
  },
  {
    "question": "A patient with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus is prescribed insulin glargine (Lantus) once daily. Which statement indicates understanding of insulin glargine administration?",
    "options": {
      "A": "I will inject insulin glargine 30 minutes before meals.",
      "B": "I will shake the insulin vial vigorously before drawing the dose.",
      "C": "I will rotate injection sites within the same body region.",
      "D": "I will administer insulin glargine with a rapid-acting insulin."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Rotating sites helps prevent lipohypertrophy and ensures consistent absorption. Insulin glargine provides steady basal insulin and should not be mixed with other insulins."
  },
  {
    "question": "A patient with a history of heart failure is prescribed digoxin. Which assessment finding indicates a potential adverse effect of digoxin therapy?",
    "options": {

      "C": "Hyperkalemia",
      "D": "Confusion"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Digoxin slows the heart by increasing vagal tone on the SA node. This can lead to bradycardia, especially at higher or toxic doses."
  },
  {
    "question": "A patient with a history of coronary artery disease is prescribed aspirin for antiplatelet therapy. Which information is important for the nurse to include in patient education about aspirin therapy?",
    "options": {

      "C": "Hypokalemia",
      "D": "Tachycardia"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Calcium channel blockers like amlodipine cause arterial vasodilation by blocking calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle. This leads to an increase in capillary pressure and fluid leakage into tissues, resulting in peripheral edema, especially in the lower extremities."
  },
