      "C": "Suxamethonium.",
      "D": "Sodium thiopentone."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Malignant Hyperthermia (MH) is a rare, life-threatening, inherited pharmacogenetic disorder of skeletal muscle that is triggered in susceptible individuals by exposure to specific anesthetic agents. The classic triggers are all volatile anesthetic gases (e.g., halothane, isoflurane) and the depolarizing neuromuscular blocker suxamethonium (succinylcholine). MH causes a hypermetabolic state with sustained muscle contraction, leading to a rapid rise in body temperature, tachycardia, acidosis, and muscle breakdown (rhabdomyolysis).\n\nAtracurium and Cisatracurium are non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockers and are considered safe to use in patients susceptible to MH. Sodium thiopentone is an ultra-short-acting barbiturate used for induction of anesthesia. It is not a trigger for MH.\n\nSigns of Malignant Hyperthermia: The earliest sign is often an unexpected rise in end-tidal CO2. Other signs include tachycardia, muscle rigidity (especially masseter/jaw rigidity), and a rapid rise in temperature (which is often a late sign).\n\nEmergency Treatment:\n- Immediately stop the triggering anesthetic agent.\n- Hyperventilate the patient with 100% oxygen.\n- Administer the antidote: Dantrolene sodium.\n- Initiate cooling measures (e.g., cool IV fluids, cooling blankets).\n- Treat acidosis and electrolyte imbalances (especially hyperkalemia from muscle breakdown)."

      "C": "Calcium supplements",
      "D": "Phenytoin"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Phenytoin (brand name Dilantin) is an anticonvulsant medication. One of its well-known, long-term side effects is gingival hyperplasia, an overgrowth of the gum tissue that can be significant and alter appearance. It can also cause a coarsening of facial features and hirsutism (excessive hair growth), which contribute to body image disturbances.\n\nDiazepam is a benzodiazepine; primary side effects are sedation and dizziness. Carbamazepine is another anticonvulsant; common side effects include dizziness, drowsiness, and a risk of agranulocytosis. Calcium supplements can cause constipation and hypercalcemia if taken in excess.\n\nOther Side Effects of Phenytoin:\n- CNS effects: Nystagmus (often an early sign of toxicity), ataxia, slurred speech, confusion.\n- Dermatologic: A rash that can progress to Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS).\n- Hematologic: Anemia.\n\nTherapeutic Drug Monitoring: Phenytoin has a narrow therapeutic range (typically 10-20 mcg/mL). Blood levels must be monitored to ensure efficacy and prevent toxicity.\n\nPatient Education: Emphasize the importance of meticulous oral hygiene (frequent brushing and flossing) to minimize gingival hyperplasia."

      "B": "Tyrosine",
      "C": "Methionine",
      "D": "Serine"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Essential amino acids are those that the human body cannot synthesize on its own and therefore must be obtained from the diet. There are nine essential amino acids. Methionine is one of them.\n\nAspartate, Tyrosine, and Serine are all non-essential amino acids, meaning the body can synthesize them from other compounds. Tyrosine is considered 'conditionally essential,' meaning it becomes essential if its precursor, phenylalanine (which is essential), is deficient.\n\nThe 9 Essential Amino Acids (Mnemonic: PVT TIM HALL):\n- Phenylalanine\n- Valine\n- Threonine\n- Tryptophan\n- Isoleucine\n- Methionine\n- Histidine\n- Arginine (sometimes considered semi-essential)\n- Leucine\n- Lysine\n\nComplete vs. Incomplete Proteins:\n- Complete proteins (e.g., from meat, dairy, eggs, soy) contain all nine essential amino acids.\n- Incomplete proteins (e.g., from most plants like beans, grains, nuts) are missing one or more essential amino acids."

    "question": "The medication of choice of treatment of status epilepticus in infants and children is:-",
    "options": {
      "A": "Phenobarbital sodium.",
      "B": "Clonazepam.",
      "C": "Phenytoin.",
      "D": "Ethosuximide"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Status epilepticus is a neurological emergency. The first-line treatment for actively seizing patients (both adults and children) is a fast-acting intravenous benzodiazepine. Clonazepam, lorazepam, and diazepam are all members of this class. They work by enhancing the effect of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, which rapidly suppresses seizure activity. Lorazepam is often preferred due to its longer duration of action.\n\nPhenobarbital and Phenytoin are longer-acting anticonvulsants. They are considered second-line agents, typically administered after a benzodiazepine has been given to stop the acute seizure, in order to prevent recurrence. Ethosuximide is a specific medication used almost exclusively for treating absence seizures ('petit mal') and is not effective for tonic-clonic status epilepticus.\n\nNursing Priorities in Status Epilepticus:\n- Airway: Maintain a patent airway (positioning, suction as needed).\n- Safety: Protect the patient from injury.\n- IV access: Establish IV access for medication administration.\n- Monitoring: Monitor vital signs and glucose levels (seizures are metabolically demanding and can cause hypoglycemia).\n\nRoutes of Administration: If IV access cannot be obtained quickly, benzodiazepines can be given via other routes, such as intranasal, buccal, or rectal (e.g., rectal diazepam gel)."

    "options": {
      "A": "Hold the breath briefly after inhaling the medication.",
      "B": "Inhale the medication quickly.",
      "C": "Inhale the medication through the nose.",
      "D": "Deliver-two sprays per breath"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Holding the breath for 5–10 seconds after a full, slow inhalation is a critical step. This allows the medication to settle deep within the airways. It prevents it from being immediately exhaled. A quick inhalation (B) causes the drug to deposit in the throat, not lungs. Inhalers are for oral use, not nasal (C). If two sprays are ordered, they must be spaced apart. Delivering them in one breath (D) reduces the second puff's effectiveness.\n\nFull MDI Technique: Shake the inhaler. Breathe out fully. Place the mouthpiece in the mouth and seal lips. Press the canister while breathing in slowly. Hold breath for 5–10 seconds. Then exhale slowly. Use of a Spacer: Recommended for children or uncoordinated patients. Improves delivery and reduces side effects. Cleaning the Inhaler: Prevents blockage. Rinsing the Mouth: Prevents oral thrush after inhaled corticosteroids."

      "B": "Mast cell stabilizer",
      "C": "Beta-2 receptor agonist",
      "D": "Leukotriene modifier"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Beta-2 agonists like albuterol are fast-acting bronchodilators. They relax airway muscles quickly. This relieves acute bronchospasm. Corticosteroids (A) reduce inflammation but act slowly. Mast cell stabilizers (B) are preventive, not for emergencies. Leukotriene modifiers (D) are also long-term control medications.\n\nSABA vs. LABA: SABA (e.g., albuterol) acts quickly for rescue. LABA (e.g., salmeterol) is used for long-term control with corticosteroids. Anticholinergics: Ipratropium may be combined with SABA during severe attacks. Patient Education: Distinguish between 'reliever' and 'controller' meds. Overuse of rescue inhalers means poor control and needs reevaluation."

      "C": "Use cool solutions other than warm solutions.",
      "D": "Tilt the head so that the ear for medication is upmost before application."
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Tilting the head ensures the medication flows down into the canal. It helps reach the target area. Cotton swabs (A) should not go into the ear canal. They risk injury or impaction. Cotton balls (B) may be used briefly but should not be tightly packed. Cool solutions (C) may trigger dizziness or vertigo.\n\nTechnique for Straightening the Ear Canal: For adults and children over 3 years, pull the pinna up and back. For children under 3, pull it down and back. Post-Administration: Stay side-lying for a few minutes. Massage the tragus gently. This helps distribute the medication evenly."

      "C": "Dorsogluteal muscles.",
      "D": "Vastus lateralis"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The ventrogluteal site is deep, away from major nerves and vessels. It is ideal for irritating or large-volume injections. The deltoid (A) is small and only for non-irritating medications. Dorsogluteal (C) is avoided due to sciatic nerve risk. Vastus lateralis (D) is preferred for infants, not adults.\n\nZ-Track Method Procedure: Displace skin laterally by 1–1.5 inches. Inject the needle at a 90-degree angle. Inject the drug slowly. Wait 10 seconds before removing the needle. Release the skin to seal the medication inside.

      "C": "Rotate the sites of injection",
      "D": "Administer the insulin at a 350 angle."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Lipodystrophy refers to changes in the subcutaneous fat at injection sites. It can manifest as either lipohypertrophy (a buildup of fat, creating a spongy lump) or lipoatrophy (a loss of fat, creating a dent). It is caused by repeatedly injecting insulin into the exact same spot. This can interfere with insulin absorption, leading to poor glycemic control. The most important intervention to prevent this is to systematically rotate injection sites.",
    "additional": "Why A, B, and D are incorrect:\nA: Cleansing the skin is important for infection control but does not prevent lipodystrophy.\nB: Aspiration is no longer recommended for subcutaneous injections like insulin.\nD: The angle for a subcutaneous injection is either 45 or 90 degrees, depending on the amount of subcutaneous fat. 350 degrees is not an angle.\n\nAdditional Possible Content to be Tested Next:\n- Insulin Injection Sites: Abdomen (most common, fastest absorption), back of the upper arms, outer thighs, and buttocks.\n- Site Rotation Plan: Instruct the patient to use one anatomical area (e.g., the abdomen) for a week, rotating sites within that area about one inch apart, before moving to a new anatomical area (e.g., the thigh). This provides more consistent absorption than randomly jumping between different body parts for each injection.\n- Types of Insulin: Rapid-acting (Lispro), Short-acting (Regular), Intermediate-acting (NPH), and Long-acting (Glargine, Detemir). Know their onset, peak, and duration."

    },
    "answer": "c",
    "explanation": "A child with immunosuppression (e.g., from chemotherapy, high-dose steroids, or an immunodeficiency disorder) is at extremely high risk for infection.\n\nPriority Nursing Goal: The number one priority is to prevent infection.\n\nIsolation: The primary way to achieve this is by placing the child in protective (or reverse) isolation. This involves measures to protect the patient from pathogens in the environment and from other people. This includes a private room, strict hand hygiene, and limiting visitors (especially those who are sick).\n\nHolistic Care: In addition to preventing infection, it is crucial to address the child's developmental and psychosocial needs. A 9-year-old is in the \"industry vs. inferiority\" stage (Erikson). Being isolated and ill can lead to feelings of inadequacy and boredom.\n\nOptimal Performance: Encouraging the child to perform at their optimal level means providing age-appropriate activities (e.g., schoolwork, games, crafts) that promote a sense of normalcy, accomplishment, and mastery. This is a critical psychosocial intervention.",
    "additional": "Analyzing Other Options:\n\n(a, d) Catheterization is an invasive procedure that significantly increases the risk of a urinary tract infection. It should be strictly avoided in an immunosuppressed child unless absolutely necessary.\n\n(b) Offering fresh fruits and vegetables is often contraindicated. Raw produce can harbor bacteria (like Pseudomonas) that could cause a serious infection in an immunosuppressed patient. These children are often placed on a neutropenic (or low-microbial) diet, which requires all foods to be thoroughly cooked.\n\nNeutropenic Precautions:\n\n- Strict handwashing is the most important measure.\n- No fresh flowers or plants in the room.\n- No sick visitors.\n- Avoid invasive procedures (rectal temperatures, suppositories, injections) when possible.\n- Monitor for the earliest signs of infection (a low-grade fever in a neutropenic patient is a medical emergency).\n\nTextbook Reference: Wong's Nursing Care of Infants and Children, Chapter 28: The Child with Cancer."

    "explanation": "This question addresses the management of an infant exposed to tuberculosis (TB) in utero or at birth.\n\nCongenital TB vs. Exposure: If the mother has active TB during pregnancy, there is a risk of transmission to the infant. The infant must be evaluated for congenital TB. However, even if the infant shows no signs of active disease, they are at very high risk of developing it.",
    "additional": "Prophylaxis: The standard of care is to provide prophylactic therapy to the asymptomatic newborn. The recommended regimen is Isoniazid (INH) given once daily for 6 months.\n\nBCG Vaccine: The BCG vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine. It should not be given to an infant who may have been exposed to TB until they have completed their course of INH prophylaxis. Giving a live vaccine to an infant who might have a latent or early infection could potentially cause disseminated BCG disease. The infant should be re-evaluated after the 6-month course of INH, and if they are disease-free, the BCG can then be administered.\n\nAnalyzing the Options:\n\n(a, d) Giving BCG immediately or at three weeks is contraindicated.\n\n(b) The duration and frequency are incorrect.

It has a rapid onset and a short half-life and is administered parenterally (IV or subcutaneously). Its effect is monitored by the aPTT (activated Partial Thromboplastin Time).\n\nAntidote: In cases of heparin overdose or life-threatening bleeding, the specific antidote is protamine sulfate. Protamine is a positively charged protein that binds tightly to the negatively charged heparin molecule, forming an inactive complex and immediately neutralizing its anticoagulant effect.",
    "additional": "Analyzing Other Options:\n\n(a) Vitamin K is the antidote for the oral anticoagulant warfarin.\n\n(b) Warfarin is another anticoagulant; it is not an antidote.\n\n(c) Thrombin is a clotting factor; it is not an antidote.\n\nAdditional Content & Future Testables:\n\nWarfarin (Coumadin): Works by inhibiting the synthesis of Vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (II, VII, IX, X). It has a slow onset of action (takes several days). Its effect is monitored by the PT/INR (Prothrombin Time / International Normalized Ratio).\n\nLow Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH): E.g., enoxaparin, dalteparin.

    },
    "answer": "c",
    "explanation": "This question asks to rank the speed of drug absorption for different routes of administration. Absorption is the process by which a drug enters the systemic circulation.\n\nFactors Affecting Absorption: The primary factor is blood flow to the site of administration. Higher blood flow leads to faster absorption.\n\nRanking the Routes (Fastest to Slowest):\n\nIntravenous (IV): Bypasses absorption completely by delivering the drug directly into the bloodstream. Onset is instantaneous.\n\nIntramuscular (IM): Muscle tissue has a rich blood supply, leading to rapid absorption.\n\nSubcutaneous (Subcut): Adipose (fatty) tissue has a poorer blood supply than muscle, leading to slower, more sustained absorption.\n\nOral (PO): Absorption is variable and generally slower. The drug must pass through the GI tract and undergo first-pass metabolism in the liver before entering systemic circulation.\n\nIntradermal (ID): A very small amount of drug is injected just under the epidermis. Blood supply is minimal, so absorption is very slow. This is ideal for allergy testing or TB skin tests, where a slow, localized reaction is desired.",
    "additional": "Conclusion: Of the options given, intramuscular provides the fastest absorption.\n\nOther Routes:\n\nInhalation: Very rapid absorption due to the large surface area and rich blood supply of the lungs (e.g., anesthetic gases, asthma inhalers).\n\nSublingual/Buccal: Placed under the tongue or in the cheek. Bypasses the GI tract and first-pass metabolism, leading to rapid absorption directly into the venous circulation (e.g., nitroglycerin).\n\nTopical/Transdermal: Applied to the skin for either local or systemic effects. Absorption is slow and sustained (e.g., nicotine patch, fentanyl patch).\n\nBioavailability: The fraction of an administered drug that reaches the systemic circulation unchanged. By definition, the bioavailability of an IV drug is 100%. Oral drugs have lower bioavailability due to incomplete absorption and first-pass metabolism.\n\nTextbook Reference: Lehne, R. A. (2019).

    },
    "answer": "d",
    "explanation": "Lactation (the production and secretion of milk) is controlled by two key hormones from the pituitary gland.\n\nProlactin (for Production):\n\nSecreted by the anterior pituitary.\n\nIts primary role is to stimulate the synthesis and production of milk within the alveolar cells of the breast.\n\nDuring pregnancy, high levels of estrogen and progesterone inhibit prolactin's effect on the breast. After delivery, these levels drop, allowing prolactin to act.\n\nThe infant's suckling at the breast is the main stimulus for continued prolactin release.\n\nOxytocin (for Ejection):\n\nProduced by the hypothalamus and released from the posterior pituitary.\n\nIts primary role is to cause the contraction of the myoepithelial cells surrounding the alveoli in the breast. This contraction squeezes the milk out of the alveoli and into the milk ducts, making it available to the infant. This process is called the milk ejection reflex or \"let-down.\"",
    "additional": "Conclusion: Prolactin MAKES the milk, and Oxytocin MOVES the milk. Both are essential for successful lactation.\n\nOther Roles of Oxytocin: Oxytocin is also the hormone responsible for causing uterine contractions during labor and after delivery to control postpartum bleeding.\n\nLet-Down Reflex: The release of oxytocin can be triggered not only by the infant's suckling but also by psychological stimuli, such as hearing a baby cry, seeing a picture of the baby, or even just thinking about the baby. It can also be inhibited by stress, pain, or embarrassment.\n\nHuman Placental Lactogen (hPL): (b) This hormone is produced by the placenta during pregnancy and is involved in preparing the breasts for lactation, but it is not directly involved in the process of lactation after birth.\n\nTextbook Reference: Lowdermilk, D.

It is a good option for patients who cannot tolerate stimulants or have a co-occurring substance use disorder.\n\nMechanism of Stimulants in ADHD: It is paradoxical. In individuals with ADHD, stimulants are thought to increase the levels of dopamine and norepinephrine in the prefrontal cortex, which improves focus, attention, and impulse control.\n\nSide Effects of Stimulants: Common side effects include decreased appetite, weight loss, insomnia, and headache.
