      "D": "Encouraging the use of mosquito repellent"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This question focuses on source reduction, a key pillar of vector control. Anopheles mosquitoes, the vectors for malaria, lay their eggs in water. By eliminating or managing standing water (e.g., draining puddles, covering water storage containers, clearing gutters), the larval stage of the mosquito life cycle is disrupted, which reduces the overall mosquito population at its source.",
    "additional": "Integrated Vector Management (IVM): This is a rational decision-making process for the optimal use of resources for vector control.
