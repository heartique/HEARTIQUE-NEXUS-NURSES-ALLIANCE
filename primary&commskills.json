    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This question defines the fundamental concept of Primary Health Care (PHC).\n\nPrimary Health Care (PHC): As defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) in the 1978 Declaration of Alma-Ata, PHC is essential health care made universally accessible to individuals and families in the community through their full participation and at a cost that the community and country can afford. It is the first level of contact for individuals, the family, and the community with the national health system.\n\nPrimary Focus: PHC is not about high-tech, specialized care (A, D) or only emergency care (C). Its focus is on providing a broad range of preventive, promotive, curative, and rehabilitative services at the community level. This includes health education, maternal and child health, immunization, control of locally endemic diseases, and treatment of common illnesses and injuries. The emphasis is on prevention and basic care.",
    "additional": "ADDITIONAL CONTENT & FUTURE FOCUS (NCK August 2025)\n\n1. The 5 Principles of Primary Health Care (Alma-Ata):\n\nEquitable Distribution: Health services must be shared equally by all people, irrespective of their ability to pay, with a focus on reaching the underserved.\n\nCommunity Participation: The community must be actively involved in the planning, implementation, and evaluation of health services.\n\nIntersectoral Coordination: Health is not just the responsibility of the health sector. It requires coordination with other sectors like education, agriculture (for nutrition), and public works (for water and sanitation).\n\nAppropriate Technology: Technology used should be scientifically sound, adaptable to local needs, and acceptable to the community.\n\nFocus on Health Promotion and Prevention: The emphasis is on keeping people healthy, not just treating them when they are sick.\n\nFuture Question Idea: \"A health program that involves the ministry of agriculture to promote kitchen gardens and the ministry of water to ensure clean wells is demonstrating which principle of Primary Health Care?\" (Answer: Intersectoral coordination).\n\nRecommended Resource:\n\nDocument: The Declaration of Alma-Ata (1978).

This is based on the principle that informed individuals are better able to take control of their own health and well-being.\n\nExample: A campaign to promote handwashing would educate people on why it's important (prevents diarrhea), when to do it (critical times), and how to do it correctly (with soap and water).",
    "additional": "ADDITIONAL CONTENT & FUTURE FOCUS (NCK August 2025)\n\n1. Health Belief Model:\nThis is a classic model used to understand and predict health behaviors, and it's useful for designing health education campaigns.

They seek to understand how toxic substances enter the body, how they are metabolized, what damage they cause, and at what levels of exposure that damage occurs. This science provides the evidence needed to set safe exposure limits for chemicals in the air, water, and food.\n\nA, C, and D are incorrect.

Key Concepts:\n- Exposure: Contact with a chemical or physical agent.\n- Hazard: The inherent potential of an agent to cause harm.\n- Risk: The probability that a substance will cause harm under specific conditions of exposure. Risk = Hazard x Exposure.
