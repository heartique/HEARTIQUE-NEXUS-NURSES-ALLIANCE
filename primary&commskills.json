    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This question defines the fundamental concept of Primary Health Care (PHC).\n\nPrimary Health Care (PHC): As defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) in the 1978 Declaration of Alma-Ata, PHC is essential health care made universally accessible to individuals and families in the community through their full participation and at a cost that the community and country can afford. It is the first level of contact for individuals, the family, and the community with the national health system.\n\nPrimary Focus: PHC is not about high-tech, specialized care (A, D) or only emergency care (C). Its focus is on providing a broad range of preventive, promotive, curative, and rehabilitative services at the community level. This includes health education, maternal and child health, immunization, control of locally endemic diseases, and treatment of common illnesses and injuries. The emphasis is on prevention and basic care.",
    "additional": "ADDITIONAL CONTENT & FUTURE FOCUS (NCK August 2025)\n\n1. The 5 Principles of Primary Health Care (Alma-Ata):\n\nEquitable Distribution: Health services must be shared equally by all people, irrespective of their ability to pay, with a focus on reaching the underserved.\n\nCommunity Participation: The community must be actively involved in the planning, implementation, and evaluation of health services.\n\nIntersectoral Coordination: Health is not just the responsibility of the health sector. It requires coordination with other sectors like education, agriculture (for nutrition), and public works (for water and sanitation).\n\nAppropriate Technology: Technology used should be scientifically sound, adaptable to local needs, and acceptable to the community.\n\nFocus on Health Promotion and Prevention: The emphasis is on keeping people healthy, not just treating them when they are sick.\n\nFuture Question Idea: \"A health program that involves the ministry of agriculture to promote kitchen gardens and the ministry of water to ensure clean wells is demonstrating which principle of Primary Health Care?\" (Answer: Intersectoral coordination).\n\nRecommended Resource:\n\nDocument: The Declaration of Alma-Ata (1978).

The goal is to produce knowledge that leads directly to action and social change, addressing the community's own health needs.\n\nB, and D are contrary to the principles of CBPR.

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This question tests the classic \"Levels of Prevention\" model, a core concept in public health.\n\nSecondary Prevention: Aims to reduce the impact of a disease that has already occurred. This is done by detecting and treating the disease as early as possible to halt or slow its progress, and to prevent complications. The focus is on early diagnosis and prompt treatment.\n\nExamples:\n\nScreening programs (e.g., mammograms for breast cancer, Pap smears for cervical cancer, blood pressure checks for hypertension).\n\nCase finding (e.g., testing the contacts of a person with TB).\n\nPrimary Prevention (A): Aims to prevent the disease from occurring in the first place (e.g., vaccination, health education on smoking cessation).\n\nTertiary Prevention (B): Aims to soften the impact of an ongoing illness or injury that has lasting effects. This involves rehabilitation, helping people manage long-term problems, and improving their quality of life (e.g., cardiac rehab after a heart attack, chronic pain management).\n\nQuaternary Prevention (D): A newer concept aimed at protecting individuals from medical interventions that are likely to do more harm than good (preventing over-medicalization).",

It involves identifying community priorities, raising awareness, and motivating people to work together to take action.\n\nInvolvement: It is a \"bottom-up\" process that moves beyond simple participation. It's about building community capacity and confidence to take charge of their own development and health. It involves a journey from initial dialogue to collective action.\n\nA, C, and D are incorrect.

They are members of a community who are chosen by the community and trained to provide basic health and medical care to their community. They are the link between the community and the formal health system.\n\nPrimary Focus: Their role is not to perform complex procedures (A) or lab research (D). Their focus is on health promotion and disease prevention at the household level. This includes:\n\nHealth Education: Teaching families about hygiene, nutrition, immunization, family planning, etc.\n\nBasic Curative Care: Identifying and treating simple childhood illnesses like diarrhea using IMCI protocols.\n\nScreening and Referral: Identifying danger signs, screening for malnutrition, and referring sick individuals to the health facility.\n\nFollow-up: Following up on clients with chronic illnesses like TB or HIV to support treatment adherence.",

This is based on the principle that informed individuals are better able to take control of their own health and well-being.\n\nExample: A campaign to promote handwashing would educate people on why it's important (prevents diarrhea), when to do it (critical times), and how to do it correctly (with soap and water).",
    "additional": "ADDITIONAL CONTENT & FUTURE FOCUS (NCK August 2025)\n\n1. Health Belief Model:\nThis is a classic model used to understand and predict health behaviors, and it's useful for designing health education campaigns. It suggests that a person's readiness to act is influenced by their beliefs about:\n\n- Perceived Susceptibility: \"Am I at risk for this disease?\"\n- Perceived Severity: \"If I get it, how serious will it be?\"\n- Perceived Benefits: \"Will the recommended action (e.g., vaccination) actually help me?\"\n- Perceived Barriers: \"What are the costs or negative aspects of taking this action?\"\n- Cues to Action: Events or messages that trigger the person to act.\n- Self-Efficacy: The person's confidence in their ability to perform the action.\n\nA good campaign will address all these points. For example, it will convince people they are at risk (susceptibility), the disease is serious (severity), the action is effective (benefits), and it's easy to do (lowering barriers).\n\nFuture Question Idea: \"A health education message that emphasizes the serious complications of untreated hypertension is targeting which component of the Health Belief Model?\" (Answer: Perceived Severity)."

    "question": "In community health, what is the primary role of a \"health promoter\"?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Providing complex medical treatments",
      "B": "Offering administrative support to healthcare facilities",
      "C": "Advocating for health-related policies",
      "D": "Empowering individuals and communities to improve their health"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This question asks for the definition of a role that embodies the principles of health promotion (as seen in Q192).\n\nHealth Promoter: This is a broad term for any professional (like a community health nurse) or lay person (like a CHV) whose work focuses on enabling people to increase control over and improve their health.\n\nPrimary Role: The role is not just to give information, but to empower. This involves a combination of activities:\n\n- Education: Providing skills and knowledge.\n- Advocacy: Speaking up for individuals and communities to create supportive environments and healthy public policies (making C a part of D).\n- Mediation: Helping to reconcile different interests in society in the pursuit of health.\n\nThe overarching goal is to build the capacity of individuals and communities to take charge of their own health, making (D) the most comprehensive and accurate answer.\n\nA and B are incorrect as they describe clinical or administrative roles, not a health promotion role.",
