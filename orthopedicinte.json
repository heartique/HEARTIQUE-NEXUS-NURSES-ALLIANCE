    "question": "When a burn occurs in an adult,",
    "options": {
      "A": "Using rule of nine, right arm is calculated as being 18% & right leg 9%.",
      "B": "Capillaries & small vessels dilate, renal blood flow reduces",
      "C": "Fluid shifts from ICF to ECF space/compartment along with potassium.",
      "D": "Permeability of the kidney tubules increases with oliguria"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Rationale for Correct Answer (B): A major burn injury triggers a massive systemic inflammatory response. Capillary & Vessel Dilation: Inflammatory mediators (like histamine) released at the burn site cause widespread vasodilation and a dramatic increase in capillary permeability. This 'leaky-pipe' syndrome is the hallmark of the initial phase of burn shock. Renal Blood Flow Reduction: As fluid leaks from the intravascular space into the interstitial space (third-spacing), the circulating blood volume plummets, leading to hypovolemia and hypotension. The body responds by shunting blood away from non-vital organs, including the kidneys, to preserve perfusion to the brain and heart. This results in significantly reduced renal blood flow, which leads to a low urine output (oliguria) and risk of acute kidney injury (AKI).",
    "additional": "Analysis of Incorrect Options: (A) The Rule of Nines for an adult assigns 9% to each full arm (front and back) and 18% to each full leg (front and back). This statement has the values reversed. (C) Fluid shifts from the intravascular space (inside blood vessels) to the interstitial space (ECF), not from the ICF (intracellular fluid) initially. Also, massive cell damage (like hemolysis of RBCs) causes a release of potassium from the cells into the ECF, leading to hyperkalemia in the initial phase. (D) Kidney tubule permeability does not increase. In fact, if renal blood flow is severely reduced, it can lead to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), where the tubules are damaged and stop functioning properly. Phases of Burn Injury: Emergent/Resuscitative Phase (First 24-48 hrs): Characterized by capillary leak, fluid shifts, edema, hypovolemia, and hyperkalemia. The priority is fluid resuscitation. Acute Phase (Begins after 24-48 hrs): Characterized by capillary healing, fluid mobilization back into the vascular space, and diuresis. The patient is now at risk for hypokalemia as potassium shifts back into the cells. Fluid Resuscitation: The Parkland (Baxter) Formula is used to calculate the amount of IV fluid (Lactated Ringer's) needed in the first 24 hours: 4 mL × kg of body weight × %TBSA burned. Half of this total volume is given in the first 8 hours (from the time of the burn), and the second half is given over the next 16 hours.

    "question": "Buck’s traction is,",
    "options": {
      "A": "a) A form of skin traction and is often used to relieve muscle spasms.",
      "B": "b) A form of skeletal traction for compound fractures.",
      "C": "c) Only used in correction of hip and femur fractures.",
      "D": "d) Always contra-indicated in obese patients."
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Rationale for Correct Answer (A): Buck's extension traction is the most common type of skin traction. In skin traction, the pulling force is applied directly to the skin using boots, belts, or splints. It uses light weights (typically 5-10 lbs) and is a temporary measure. One of its primary indications is to immobilize a limb, reduce pain, and relieve muscle spasms in patients with hip or femoral fractures before they can be taken to surgery.",
    "additional": "Analysis of Incorrect Options: (B) Buck's is skin traction, not skeletal traction. Skeletal traction involves inserting pins or wires directly into the bone, allowing for much heavier weights to be used for long-term realignment of fractures. A compound (open) fracture would require skeletal traction or surgery, not skin traction, due to the break in the skin. (C) While it is very commonly used for hip and femur fractures, it can also be used for other lower limb conditions. The word 'only' makes this statement too restrictive. (D) Obesity is not an absolute contraindication, although it can make skin traction less effective and increases the risk of skin breakdown. Skin vs. Skeletal Traction: | Feature | Skin Traction (e.g., Buck's) | Skeletal Traction | | :--- | :--- | :--- | | Application | Applied to the skin (boots, slings) | Pins/wires inserted into the bone | | Weight | Light weights (5-10 lbs) | Heavy weights (up to 25-40 lbs) | | Duration | Short-term, temporary | Can be used for longer periods | | Purpose | Immobilize, reduce muscle spasm, reduce pain | Realign fractures, overcome muscle shortening | Nursing Care for Traction: Maintain Alignment: Ensure the patient is centered in the bed and the line of pull is straight. Weights Must Hang Free: The weights should never be resting on the floor or the bed frame. Ropes in Pulleys: Ensure ropes are unobstructed and moving freely in the pulley grooves. Neurovascular Checks: Perform frequent neurovascular assessments (6 P's) on the affected limb. Skin Integrity: Check the skin for breakdown, especially under the boot or straps. For skeletal traction, provide pin site care as ordered to prevent infection.

    "question": "For a patient with cellulitis the nurse should,",
    "options": {
      "A": "A. Apply warm compresses to the site and elevate affected extremity",
      "B": "B. Apply cold compresses to the site and elevate affected extremity",
      "C": "C. Administer topical antibiotics and oral analgesics as prescribed",
      "D": "D. Administer plasma expanders and elevate the affected limb to 90o"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Rationale for Correct Answer (A): Cellulitis is a common bacterial infection of the skin and the subcutaneous tissues. The primary goals of care are to treat the infection and manage the local inflammatory response (redness, swelling, pain, warmth). Elevate Affected Extremity: Elevation helps to reduce edema (swelling) by promoting venous and lymphatic drainage. This decreases pressure in the tissues and can help alleviate pain. Apply Warm Compresses: Warm, moist compresses increase circulation to the affected area. This vasodilation helps to bring more white blood cells and antibiotics to the site of infection to fight the bacteria and promotes the localization and drainage of any purulent material.",
    "additional": "Analysis of Incorrect Options: (B) Cold compresses cause vasoconstriction and would be used for an acute traumatic injury (like a sprain) to reduce swelling and inflammation. For an infection like cellulitis, the goal is to increase circulation to the area. (C) While oral or IV antibiotics (not usually topical for diffuse cellulitis) and oral analgesics are the mainstay of pharmacologic treatment, the question asks what the nurse should do in terms of direct care interventions. (A) describes the classic nursing comfort and therapeutic measures. (D) Plasma expanders are used to treat shock or severe hypovolemia, not localized cellulitis. Elevating a limb to 90 degrees is extreme and generally not necessary or comfortable. Causative Organisms: Most commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. Systemic Treatment: The cornerstone of treatment is systemic antibiotics (oral for mild cases, IV for severe cases). Nursing Care: Administer antibiotics as prescribed. Monitor the site for spreading redness (often by marking the borders of the erythema with a pen). Monitor for signs of systemic infection (fever, chills, tachycardia). Provide pain management. Elevate the limb and apply warm compresses.

    "question": "A patient with a sprained ankle should be advised to avoid:",
    "options": {
      "A": "Resting the foot",
      "B": "Applying a heating pad",
      "C": "Applying an elastic compression bandage",
      "D": "Elevating the ankle on a pillow while sitting or lying down"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Rationale for Correct Answer (B): A sprain is an acute injury to a ligament caused by stretching or tearing. The initial inflammatory response involves vasodilation, bleeding into the tissues, and swelling. The primary goal of immediate care (first 24-48 hours) is to reduce this inflammation and swelling. Applying heat (like a heating pad) causes vasodilation, which would increase blood flow to the area, thereby worsening the swelling, bleeding, and pain. Heat is contraindicated in the acute phase of this type of injury.",
    "additional": "Analysis of Correct Interventions (RICE): The standard immediate treatment for a sprain is the RICE mnemonic: (A) Rest: Resting the foot is crucial to prevent further injury and allow healing to begin. (C) Compression: Applying an elastic compression bandage helps to limit swelling and provide support. (D) Elevation: Elevating the ankle above the level of the heart uses gravity to help drain excess fluid from the area, reducing swelling. I - Ice: The missing component. Applying cold packs or ice is the correct thermal intervention. Cold causes vasoconstriction, which decreases blood flow, limits swelling, and helps numb the area to reduce pain. Heat vs. Cold Therapy: Use COLD for ACUTE injuries (first 24-48 hrs): Sprains, strains, bruises. Its purpose is to cause vasoconstriction to decrease swelling, bleeding, and pain. Use HEAT for CHRONIC conditions or LATER in recovery: Muscle soreness, stiffness, arthritis. Its purpose is to cause vasodilation to increase blood flow, relax muscles, and relieve stiffness. How NCK Might Test This: They will give a scenario of an acute injury and ask for the appropriate or inappropriate intervention, testing your knowledge of RICE and the heat vs. cold principle.

    "question": "Risk for osteoporosis is greatest in:",
    "options": {
      "A": "A 36-year-old man who has asthma",
      "B": "A 70-year-old man who consumes alcohol",
      "C": "A sedentary 65-year-old woman who smokes cigarettes",
      "D": "A 25-year-old woman who jogs"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Rationale for Correct Answer (C): Osteoporosis is a metabolic bone disease characterized by low bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue, leading to increased bone fragility and risk of fracture. This option presents a patient with a combination of the most significant risk factors: Age: Bone loss accelerates after age 30-35. Being 65 is a major risk factor. Gender/Menopause: Women have a higher risk than men. Post-menopausal women are at the highest risk because of the cessation of estrogen production, which is protective of bone density. Sedentary Lifestyle: Weight-bearing exercise (like walking, jogging) is essential for stimulating bone formation. A sedentary lifestyle leads to bone loss. Smoking: Smoking is a major risk factor that decreases calcium absorption and inhibits the activity of osteoblasts (bone-building cells).",
    "additional": "Analysis of Incorrect Options: (A) A 36-year-old man is at low risk due to age and gender. While long-term use of systemic corticosteroids for asthma is a risk factor, it is not mentioned here. (B) A 70-year-old man has age as a risk factor, and excessive alcohol consumption is also a risk factor. However, the combination of female gender, post-menopausal status, sedentary lifestyle, and smoking in option (C) presents a far greater cumulative risk. (D) A 25-year-old woman is at low risk due to her young age and pre-menopausal status. Jogging is a weight-bearing exercise that protects against osteoporosis. Major Risk Factors for Osteoporosis: Non-modifiable: Female gender, advancing age, Caucasian or Asian race, small frame, family history. Modifiable: Low calcium and Vitamin D intake, sedentary lifestyle, cigarette smoking, excessive alcohol intake, use of certain medications (corticosteroids, some anticonvulsants). Prevention & Treatment: Adequate intake of calcium and Vitamin D. Regular weight-bearing and muscle-strengthening exercise. Smoking cessation and moderation of alcohol. Medications: Bisphosphonates (e.g., alendronate) are the first-line treatment. They work by inhibiting osteoclast activity, thus slowing bone resorption.

    "question": "Body mechanics usually prescribed for clients with low back pain include:",
    "options": {
      "A": "Bending at knee and hips, standing straight, carrying objects close to the body.",
      "B": "Bending at the waist carrying objects close to the body, standing straight.",
      "C": "Sleeping on the side carrying objects farther from the body, bending at the knees and hips.",
      "D": "Bending at the waist, sleeping on the side, standing straight."
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Rationale for Correct Answer (A): This option lists the three core principles of proper body mechanics designed to protect the lower back (lumbar spine). Bending at knee and hips: When lifting an object from the floor, one should bend at the knees and hips (squatting), using the strong muscles of the legs to lift, while keeping the back straight. Bending at the waist puts all the strain directly on the lumbar spine. Standing straight: Maintaining good posture with the spine in neutral alignment reduces strain. Carrying objects close to the body: Holding an object close to your center of gravity reduces the lever arm effect and decreases the force exerted on the spine.",
    "additional": "Analysis of Incorrect Options: (B) & (D) Both include \"bending at the waist,\" which is the primary action to AVOID as it is the leading cause of low back strain. (C) \"Carrying objects farther from the body\" is incorrect and increases the strain on the back. Principles of Good Body Mechanics: Use a wide base of support. Bend at the knees, not the waist. Keep your back straight. Carry objects close to your body. Avoid twisting your spine; pivot with your feet instead. Push or pull objects rather than lifting them when possible. Patient Education for Low Back Pain: Besides body mechanics, teaching includes proper sleeping positions (on the side with a pillow between the knees, or on the back with a pillow under the knees to maintain lumbar curvature) and core strengthening exercises.
