      "B": "Capillaries & small vessels dilate, renal blood flow reduces",
      "C": "Fluid shifts from ICF to ECF space/compartment along with potassium.",
      "D": "Permeability of the kidney tubules increases with oliguria"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Rationale for Correct Answer (B): A major burn injury triggers a massive systemic inflammatory response. Capillary & Vessel Dilation: Inflammatory mediators (like histamine) released at the burn site cause widespread vasodilation and a dramatic increase in capillary permeability. This 'leaky-pipe' syndrome is the hallmark of the initial phase of burn shock. Renal Blood Flow Reduction: As fluid leaks from the intravascular space into the interstitial space (third-spacing), the circulating blood volume plummets, leading to hypovolemia and hypotension. The body responds by shunting blood away from non-vital organs, including the kidneys, to preserve perfusion to the brain and heart. This results in significantly reduced renal blood flow, which leads to a low urine output (oliguria) and risk of acute kidney injury (AKI).",
    "additional": "Analysis of Incorrect Options: (A) The Rule of Nines for an adult assigns 9% to each full arm (front and back) and 18% to each full leg (front and back). This statement has the values reversed. (C) Fluid shifts from the intravascular space (inside blood vessels) to the interstitial space (ECF), not from the ICF (intracellular fluid) initially. Also, massive cell damage (like hemolysis of RBCs) causes a release of potassium from the cells into the ECF, leading to hyperkalemia in the initial phase. (D) Kidney tubule permeability does not increase. In fact, if renal blood flow is severely reduced, it can lead to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), where the tubules are damaged and stop functioning properly. Phases of Burn Injury: Emergent/Resuscitative Phase (First 24-48 hrs): Characterized by capillary leak, fluid shifts, edema, hypovolemia, and hyperkalemia. The priority is fluid resuscitation. Acute Phase (Begins after 24-48 hrs): Characterized by capillary healing, fluid mobilization back into the vascular space, and diuresis. The patient is now at risk for hypokalemia as potassium shifts back into the cells. Fluid Resuscitation: The Parkland (Baxter) Formula is used to calculate the amount of IV fluid (Lactated Ringer's) needed in the first 24 hours: 4 mL × kg of body weight × %TBSA burned. Half of this total volume is given in the first 8 hours (from the time of the burn), and the second half is given over the next 16 hours.

      "A": "a) A form of skin traction and is often used to relieve muscle spasms.",
      "B": "b) A form of skeletal traction for compound fractures.",
      "C": "c) Only used in correction of hip and femur fractures.",
      "D": "d) Always contra-indicated in obese patients."
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Rationale for Correct Answer (A): Buck's extension traction is the most common type of skin traction. In skin traction, the pulling force is applied directly to the skin using boots, belts, or splints. It uses light weights (typically 5-10 lbs) and is a temporary measure. One of its primary indications is to immobilize a limb, reduce pain, and relieve muscle spasms in patients with hip or femoral fractures before they can be taken to surgery.",
    "additional": "Analysis of Incorrect Options: (B) Buck's is skin traction, not skeletal traction. Skeletal traction involves inserting pins or wires directly into the bone, allowing for much heavier weights to be used for long-term realignment of fractures. A compound (open) fracture would require skeletal traction or surgery, not skin traction, due to the break in the skin. (C) While it is very commonly used for hip and femur fractures, it can also be used for other lower limb conditions. The word 'only' makes this statement too restrictive. (D) Obesity is not an absolute contraindication, although it can make skin traction less effective and increases the risk of skin breakdown. Skin vs. Skeletal Traction: | Feature | Skin Traction (e.g., Buck's) | Skeletal Traction | | :--- | :--- | :--- | | Application | Applied to the skin (boots, slings) | Pins/wires inserted into the bone | | Weight | Light weights (5-10 lbs) | Heavy weights (up to 25-40 lbs) | | Duration | Short-term, temporary | Can be used for longer periods | | Purpose | Immobilize, reduce muscle spasm, reduce pain | Realign fractures, overcome muscle shortening | Nursing Care for Traction: Maintain Alignment: Ensure the patient is centered in the bed and the line of pull is straight. Weights Must Hang Free: The weights should never be resting on the floor or the bed frame. Ropes in Pulleys: Ensure ropes are unobstructed and moving freely in the pulley grooves. Neurovascular Checks: Perform frequent neurovascular assessments (6 P's) on the affected limb. Skin Integrity: Check the skin for breakdown, especially under the boot or straps. For skeletal traction, provide pin site care as ordered to prevent infection.

      "C": "C. Administer topical antibiotics and oral analgesics as prescribed",
      "D": "D. Administer plasma expanders and elevate the affected limb to 90o"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Rationale for Correct Answer (A): Cellulitis is a common bacterial infection of the skin and the subcutaneous tissues. The primary goals of care are to treat the infection and manage the local inflammatory response (redness, swelling, pain, warmth). Elevate Affected Extremity: Elevation helps to reduce edema (swelling) by promoting venous and lymphatic drainage. This decreases pressure in the tissues and can help alleviate pain. Apply Warm Compresses: Warm, moist compresses increase circulation to the affected area. This vasodilation helps to bring more white blood cells and antibiotics to the site of infection to fight the bacteria and promotes the localization and drainage of any purulent material.",
    "additional": "Analysis of Incorrect Options: (B) Cold compresses cause vasoconstriction and would be used for an acute traumatic injury (like a sprain) to reduce swelling and inflammation. For an infection like cellulitis, the goal is to increase circulation to the area. (C) While oral or IV antibiotics (not usually topical for diffuse cellulitis) and oral analgesics are the mainstay of pharmacologic treatment, the question asks what the nurse should do in terms of direct care interventions. (A) describes the classic nursing comfort and therapeutic measures. (D) Plasma expanders are used to treat shock or severe hypovolemia, not localized cellulitis. Elevating a limb to 90 degrees is extreme and generally not necessary or comfortable. Causative Organisms: Most commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. Systemic Treatment: The cornerstone of treatment is systemic antibiotics (oral for mild cases, IV for severe cases). Nursing Care: Administer antibiotics as prescribed. Monitor the site for spreading redness (often by marking the borders of the erythema with a pen). Monitor for signs of systemic infection (fever, chills, tachycardia). Provide pain management. Elevate the limb and apply warm compresses.

    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Rationale for Correct Answer (B): A sprain is an acute injury to a ligament caused by stretching or tearing. The initial inflammatory response involves vasodilation, bleeding into the tissues, and swelling. The primary goal of immediate care (first 24-48 hours) is to reduce this inflammation and swelling. Applying heat (like a heating pad) causes vasodilation, which would increase blood flow to the area, thereby worsening the swelling, bleeding, and pain. Heat is contraindicated in the acute phase of this type of injury.",
    "additional": "Analysis of Correct Interventions (RICE): The standard immediate treatment for a sprain is the RICE mnemonic: (A) Rest: Resting the foot is crucial to prevent further injury and allow healing to begin. (C) Compression: Applying an elastic compression bandage helps to limit swelling and provide support. (D) Elevation: Elevating the ankle above the level of the heart uses gravity to help drain excess fluid from the area, reducing swelling. I - Ice: The missing component. Applying cold packs or ice is the correct thermal intervention. Cold causes vasoconstriction, which decreases blood flow, limits swelling, and helps numb the area to reduce pain. Heat vs. Cold Therapy: Use COLD for ACUTE injuries (first 24-48 hrs): Sprains, strains, bruises. Its purpose is to cause vasoconstriction to decrease swelling, bleeding, and pain. Use HEAT for CHRONIC conditions or LATER in recovery: Muscle soreness, stiffness, arthritis. Its purpose is to cause vasodilation to increase blood flow, relax muscles, and relieve stiffness. How NCK Might Test This: They will give a scenario of an acute injury and ask for the appropriate or inappropriate intervention, testing your knowledge of RICE and the heat vs. cold principle.

      "D": "A 25-year-old woman who jogs"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Rationale for Correct Answer (C): Osteoporosis is a metabolic bone disease characterized by low bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue, leading to increased bone fragility and risk of fracture. This option presents a patient with a combination of the most significant risk factors: Age: Bone loss accelerates after age 30-35. Being 65 is a major risk factor. Gender/Menopause: Women have a higher risk than men. Post-menopausal women are at the highest risk because of the cessation of estrogen production, which is protective of bone density. Sedentary Lifestyle: Weight-bearing exercise (like walking, jogging) is essential for stimulating bone formation. A sedentary lifestyle leads to bone loss. Smoking: Smoking is a major risk factor that decreases calcium absorption and inhibits the activity of osteoblasts (bone-building cells).",
    "additional": "Analysis of Incorrect Options: (A) A 36-year-old man is at low risk due to age and gender. While long-term use of systemic corticosteroids for asthma is a risk factor, it is not mentioned here. (B) A 70-year-old man has age as a risk factor, and excessive alcohol consumption is also a risk factor. However, the combination of female gender, post-menopausal status, sedentary lifestyle, and smoking in option (C) presents a far greater cumulative risk. (D) A 25-year-old woman is at low risk due to her young age and pre-menopausal status. Jogging is a weight-bearing exercise that protects against osteoporosis. Major Risk Factors for Osteoporosis: Non-modifiable: Female gender, advancing age, Caucasian or Asian race, small frame, family history. Modifiable: Low calcium and Vitamin D intake, sedentary lifestyle, cigarette smoking, excessive alcohol intake, use of certain medications (corticosteroids, some anticonvulsants). Prevention & Treatment: Adequate intake of calcium and Vitamin D. Regular weight-bearing and muscle-strengthening exercise. Smoking cessation and moderation of alcohol. Medications: Bisphosphonates (e.g., alendronate) are the first-line treatment. They work by inhibiting osteoclast activity, thus slowing bone resorption.

      "D": "Bending at the waist, sleeping on the side, standing straight."
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Rationale for Correct Answer (A): This option lists the three core principles of proper body mechanics designed to protect the lower back (lumbar spine). Bending at knee and hips: When lifting an object from the floor, one should bend at the knees and hips (squatting), using the strong muscles of the legs to lift, while keeping the back straight. Bending at the waist puts all the strain directly on the lumbar spine. Standing straight: Maintaining good posture with the spine in neutral alignment reduces strain. Carrying objects close to the body: Holding an object close to your center of gravity reduces the lever arm effect and decreases the force exerted on the spine.",
    "additional": "Analysis of Incorrect Options: (B) & (D) Both include \"bending at the waist,\" which is the primary action to AVOID as it is the leading cause of low back strain. (C) \"Carrying objects farther from the body\" is incorrect and increases the strain on the back. Principles of Good Body Mechanics: Use a wide base of support. Bend at the knees, not the waist. Keep your back straight. Carry objects close to your body. Avoid twisting your spine; pivot with your feet instead. Push or pull objects rather than lifting them when possible. Patient Education for Low Back Pain: Besides body mechanics, teaching includes proper sleeping positions (on the side with a pillow between the knees, or on the back with a pillow under the knees to maintain lumbar curvature) and core strengthening exercises.

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Background: After a cast is applied, a critical nursing responsibility is to perform frequent neurovascular assessments to detect signs of complications like compartment syndrome, nerve damage, or circulatory impairment. This assessment is often remembered by the mnemonic \"The 6 P's\".\n\n(C) Why it's correct: This option lists three key components of a neurovascular check.\n\nCapillary Refill: A measure of peripheral perfusion. It should be brisk (< 3 seconds).\n\nSensation: Assesses nerve function. The patient should be able to feel light touch. Paresthesia (numbness and tingling) is a key early sign of compartment syndrome.\n\nMuscle Power (Motor Function): Assesses nerve function. The patient should be able to move the digits (toes in this case) distal to the cast.\n\n(A) Why it's incorrect: While color and sensation are correct, checking pulses distal to the cast is essential. However, \"pulses\" may be difficult or impossible to palpate through a cast. Capillary refill is a more accessible perfusion check. Option (C) is more comprehensive.\n\n(B) Why it's incorrect: Level of consciousness and limb symmetry are part of a general or neurological assessment, not a specific neurovascular check of the affected limb.\n\n(D) Why it's incorrect: This is a good answer, but (C) is slightly better because \"sensation\" is a more specific neurological term than \"warmth\" (which is a vascular sign) and is a critical component for detecting nerve compression.",

The standard of care for these open wounds is to keep the underlying tissue viable and moist to promote healing. This is best achieved with sterile saline-moistened dressings (often called wet-to-damp dressings).\n\nIncorrect (a): A dry sterile dressing would stick to the wound bed, causing pain and trauma to the healing tissue upon removal.\n\nIncorrect (b): Hydrocolloid dressings are occlusive and are used for clean, non-infected, partial-thickness wounds with minimal drainage, not large, open surgical wounds like a fasciotomy.\n\nIncorrect (d): Betadine (povidone-iodine) is cytotoxic, meaning it is toxic to healthy healing cells like fibroblasts. Its use on open wounds is now discouraged as it can impair wound healing. Sterile normal saline is the preferred cleansing and dressing solution.",

  "question": "Limb traction helps to,",
  "options": {
    "A": "Relieve pain, achieve hemostasis and prevent deep venous thrombosis",
    "B": "Restore nerves function, maintain bone alignment & correct deformities",
    "C": "Rest inflamed joints, restore limb and muscle size, prevent contractures",
    "D": "Promote movement with ease, restore blood flow & reduce embolism"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "explanation": "This question asks for the primary goals or purposes of applying limb traction.\n\nPrimary Goals of Traction:\nImmobilize a fracture: To prevent further injury to soft tissues.\nReduce a fracture or dislocation: To pull bone fragments back into their proper anatomical position.\nMaintain bone alignment: To hold the fragments in place while healing begins, especially pre-operatively.\nRelieve pain from muscle spasms: The constant, steady pull fatigues the muscles, causing them to relax.\nCorrect or prevent deformities: Used in conditions like scoliosis or to prevent contractures after burns.\n\nAnalyzing the Options:\n(a) It does relieve pain, but it does not \"achieve hemostasis\" (stop bleeding) directly. Immobilization from traction increases the risk of DVT.\n(b) This option contains the most correct primary goals. It is used to maintain bone alignment and correct deformities. While it doesn't \"restore\" nerve function, by relieving pressure on nerves from displaced bone fragments, it can prevent further nerve damage.\n(c) It does rest joints and can help prevent contractures, but it does not \"restore\" limb and muscle size (disuse leads to atrophy).\n(d) It prevents movement, it doesn't promote it. It can compromise blood flow if not applied correctly. It helps prevent DVT, which reduces the risk of pulmonary embolism, but doesn't \"reduce embolism\" directly.",
  "additional": "Additional Content & Future Testables:\nSee Question 50 for a detailed breakdown of Nursing Care for Patients in Traction.\n\nKey Principles:\nTraction must be continuous, never interrupted.\nWeights must hang freely.\nGood body alignment is essential.\nCounter-traction must be maintained.\nFocus on preventing the hazards of immobility (skin breakdown, DVT, pneumonia, constipation).\n\nTextbook Reference: Brunner & Suddarth's Textbook of Medical-Surgical Nursing, Chapter 40: Management of Patients With Musculoskeletal Trauma."

  "question": "The gastro-intestinal complications associated with burns include;",
  "options": {
    "A": "Paralytic ileus and Curling's ulcers.",
    "B": "Gastric distension and pancreatitis.",
    "C": "Gastric bleeding and mechanical intestinal obstruction.",
    "D": "Abdominal compartment syndromme and peptic ulcers."
  },
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Major burns (>20% TBSA) induce a massive systemic stress response that significantly affects the gastrointestinal system.\n\nParalytic Ileus: During the emergent phase, the stress response and hypovolemia cause blood to be shunted away from the GI tract to vital organs (heart, brain). This decreased perfusion, along with the influence of inflammatory mediators, often leads to a cessation of normal intestinal peristalsis, known as a paralytic ileus. This is why burn patients are kept NPO (nothing by mouth) and often have a nasogastric tube placed for decompression initially.\n\nCurling's Ulcer: This is a specific type of acute stress ulcer that occurs in the duodenum or stomach of burn patients. The physiological stress of the burn leads to increased gastric acid secretion and decreased mucosal blood flow, making the GI lining vulnerable to ulceration and bleeding.\n\nConclusion: The combination of paralytic ileus and Curling's ulcer are the classic GI complications associated with major burns.",
  "additional": "Additional Content & Future Testables:\n\nCushing's Ulcer vs. Curling's Ulcer: A common point of confusion.\nCurling's Ulcer: Associated with Burns.\nCushing's Ulcer: Associated with severe Head Trauma/Brain Injury. Increased intracranial pressure stimulates the vagus nerve, causing hypersecretion of gastric acid.\n\nNutritional Support in Burns: Burn patients are in a hypermetabolic, hypercatabolic state and have immense nutritional needs to support wound healing and immune function. Enteral nutrition (tube feeding) is started as soon as bowel sounds return (usually within 24-48 hours) to maintain gut integrity and prevent bacterial translocation.\n\nAbdominal Compartment Syndrome: While this can occur (especially with massive fluid resuscitation and extensive trunk burns), paralytic ileus and Curling's ulcers are more universally recognized as the primary GI complications.\n\nTextbook Reference: Lewis's Medical-Surgical Nursing: Assessment and Management of Clinical Problems, Chapter 24: Nursing Management: Burns."

  "question": "When estimating the size of burns, the palm of the patient's hand represents total body surface area of:-",
  "options": {
    "A": "3%.",
    "B": "1%.",
    "C": "4.5%.",
    "D": "9%."
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "explanation": "This question refers to a method used to estimate the extent of a burn, which is crucial for calculating fluid resuscitation needs.\n\nRule of Nines: This is the most common method for estimating Total Body Surface Area (TBSA) percentage in adults. It divides the body into sections that are multiples of 9% (e.g., each full arm is 9%, each full leg is 18%, the anterior trunk is 18%, the head is 9%).\n\nRule of Palms (or Palmar Method): This method is used for smaller, scattered, or patchy burns where the Rule of Nines is not practical. It uses the surface area of the patient's own palm, including their fingers held together, as a reference. This area is estimated to be approximately 1% of their TBSA. This allows for a quick estimation of the burn size by \"measuring\" how many \"palms\" would cover the burned area.",
  "additional": "Additional Content & Future Testables:\n\nLund-Browder Chart: This is a more accurate method, especially for children, as it takes into account the changes in body proportions with age (e.g., a child's head makes up a larger percentage of their TBSA than an adult's).\n\nFluid Resuscitation (Parkland Formula): This is a critical and frequently tested concept.\nFormula: 4 mL x kg of body weight x % TBSA burned\nAdministration: The total volume calculated is the amount of lactated Ringer's solution to be given over 24 hours.\nThe first half of the total volume is given over the first 8 hours (from the time of the burn, not the time of hospital arrival).\nThe second half is given over the next 16 hours.\n\nPhases of Burn Management:\nEmergent/Resuscitative Phase (First 24-48 hrs): Focus is on ABCs (airway management, especially with inhalation injury), fluid resuscitation to prevent hypovolemic shock, and pain control.\nAcute Phase: Begins after fluid resuscitation is stable and ends when the wounds are covered. Focus is on wound care, infection prevention, pain management, and nutritional support.\nRehabilitative Phase: Focus is on restoring function, preventing contractures, and psychosocial support.\n\nTextbook Reference: Lewis's Medical-Surgical Nursing: Assessment and Management of Clinical Problems, Chapter 24: Nursing Management: Burns."

  "question": "Impetigo contagiosa is;",
  "options": {
    "A": "Primarily the result of allergies",
    "B": "A fungal infection",
    "C": "Best treated with benzyl benzoate",
    "D": "Caused by beta hemolytic streptococcus"
  },
  "answer": "D",
  "explanation": "Impetigo is a common and highly contagious superficial skin infection.\n\nEtiology: It is a bacterial infection, not allergic (a) or fungal (b). The two main causative organisms are:\nStaphylococcus aureus (most common cause).\nStreptococcus pyogenes (also known as Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus).\n\nPresentation: It typically presents as vesicles or pustules that rupture, leaving a characteristic honey-colored crust. It is most common in children and often appears on the face around the nose and mouth.\n\nTreatment:\nTopical: For localized, mild infections, topical antibiotics like mupirocin are used.\nSystemic: For widespread or more severe infections, oral antibiotics (e.g., cephalexin, dicloxacillin) are required.\n\nAnalyzing the Options: Option (d) lists one of the two primary bacterial causes, making it the correct answer. Benzyl benzoate (c) is a treatment for scabies, a parasitic mite infestation, not a bacterial infection.",
  "additional": "Additional Content & Future Testables:\n\nComplication of Streptococcal Impetigo: A potential and serious complication is post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN). This is an inflammatory kidney disease that can occur 1-2 weeks after a streptococcal skin or throat infection. This is why it is important to treat streptococcal infections effectively.\n\nNursing Interventions & Patient Education:\nContagion: Emphasize that impetigo is highly contagious. Teach strict hand hygiene.\nCare: The patient should not share towels, linens, or utensils. Fingernails should be kept short to prevent scratching and autoinoculation (spreading the infection to other parts of the body).\nTreatment: Instruct on proper application of topical antibiotics or the importance of completing the full course of oral antibiotics. Soaking the crusts with a warm, wet cloth can help to gently remove them before applying ointment.\n\nTextbook Reference: Brunner & Suddarth's Textbook of Medical-Surgical Nursing, Chapter 61: Management of Patients With Dermatologic Problems."
