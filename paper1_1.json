    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "📘 Unit Integration: Pediatric Nursing, Developmental Psychology, Genetics, and Public Health.\n\n📌 Rationale: The prognosis of intellectual disability (formerly 'mental retardation') depends largely on the underlying cause or etiology. Genetic conditions (e.g., Down syndrome), perinatal insults (e.g., asphyxia), and environmental exposures (e.g., lead poisoning) play a central role in determining the trajectory and potential for improvement. IQ is a static measure and doesn't predict outcomes without understanding etiology. Delayed milestones and post-natal factors are often consequences rather than determinants.\n\n📚 Source Concepts: WHO Child Development Milestones, Lewis’s Medical-Surgical Nursing, and NCK syllabus under Pediatric Cognitive Disorders.",

Etiology determines care plan and referral level."

    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "📘 Unit Integration: Obstetrics, Pathophysiology, Maternal & Child Health, Pharmacology.\n\n📌 Rationale: Preeclampsia leads to vasospasm and reduced uteroplacental perfusion, which deprives the fetus of oxygen and nutrients. This commonly results in intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and increases the risk of premature delivery due to maternal or fetal complications. Macrosomia is not typical in preeclampsia — it's more associated with gestational diabetes.\n\n📚 Source Concepts: WHO Guidelines on Hypertensive Disorders in Pregnancy, NCK Maternal Health Module, and Myles Textbook for Midwives.",

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "📘 Unit Integration: Anatomy & Physiology, Obstetrics, Hormonal Regulation.\n\n📌 Rationale: During pregnancy, relaxin and progesterone are responsible for softening the pelvic ligaments and joints in preparation for childbirth. This ligament laxity leads to a shift in posture and strain on the lumbar spine, causing lower back pain. Estrogen also increases but isn't directly linked to ligament relaxation.\n\n📚 Source Concepts: Dutta’s Obstetrics, NCK Reproductive Health Guidelines, and Anatomy of Pregnancy from Marieb's Human Anatomy & Physiology.",

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "📘 Unit Integration: Community Health Nursing, Maternal and Child Health, Health Education & Communication.\n\n📌 Rationale: The effectiveness of postnatal care depends heavily on whether the mother has received and understood key health messages regarding hygiene, nutrition, breastfeeding, danger signs, and follow-up. Health education empowers mothers to seek help and practice appropriate self-care. Facility access and midwife visits are important but depend on whether the mother knows what to do.\n\n📚 Source Concepts: WHO Postnatal Guidelines, NCK Maternal & Child Health Manual, and Health Promotion models.",

    "explanation": "📘 Unit Integration: Obstetrics, Emergency Care, Pathophysiology.\n\n📌 Rationale: The hallmark signs of ectopic pregnancy (extra-uterine) are lower abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding, often in the first trimester. These symptoms occur as the growing embryo stretches or ruptures the fallopian tube. Breast tenderness and morning sickness are general pregnancy symptoms. Absence of fetal movements comes later in pregnancy.\n\n📚 Source Concepts: Emergency Obstetric Care by WHO, NCK Emergency Management module, and Myles Textbook for Midwives.",

    "explanation": "📘 Unit Integration: Critical Care Nursing, Pathophysiology, Cardiovascular System.\n\n📌 Rationale: Cardiogenic shock occurs when the heart's pumping ability is compromised, most commonly due to a myocardial infarction (MI). An MI causes damage to the heart muscle, reducing cardiac output and leading to hypoperfusion.
