They are testing boundaries and trying to control their environment, which is the central task of this stage.\n\nA (Infancy), B (Toddlerhood), and D (School Age) deal with other psychosocial crises (trust, independence, and competence, respectively).",

    "explanation": "This question asks to apply a major psychological perspective to a specific clinical presentation.\n\nBehavioral Perspective: This perspective focuses on observable behaviors and explains them as a result of learning through conditioning. In the case of OCD, the behavioral model explains the compulsions (like hand-washing) as a learned response.\n\nMechanism (Operant Conditioning): The person has an obsession (e.g., \"my hands are contaminated\"). This causes anxiety. They perform the compulsion (hand-washing). The hand-washing temporarily reduces the anxiety. This reduction in anxiety acts as a negative reinforcement, which makes the person more likely to wash their hands again the next time they have the obsessive thought. The behavior is \"reinforced\" by the removal of an unpleasant feeling.\n\nCognitive (B): Would focus on the intrusive, irrational thoughts (obsessions) themselves.\n\nPsychodynamic (D): Would look for unconscious conflicts from childhood as the root cause.\n\nHumanistic (A): Would focus on the person's potential for self-actualization and personal growth.",

    "explanation": "The question describes the hallmark feature of bipolar disorder: the presence of distinct mood episodes that represent a significant change from the person's usual functioning.\n\nBipolar Disorder: A mood disorder characterized by shifts between episodes of mania or hypomania and episodes of major depression.\n\nManic Episode: A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and increased energy, lasting at least one week.\n\nDepressive Episode: A period of at least two weeks with depressed mood or loss of interest/pleasure.\n\nSchizophrenia (A) is a psychotic disorder characterized by hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thought, not primary mood episodes.\n\nBorderline Personality Disorder (B) involves mood instability, but it is typically more rapid and reactive to interpersonal stressors, rather than the sustained, distinct episodes seen in bipolar disorder.\n\nMajor Depressive Disorder (D) involves only depressive episodes, without any history of mania or hypomania.",
    "additional": "ADDITIONAL CONTENT & FUTURE FOCUS (NCK August 2025)\n\n1. Types of Bipolar Disorder:\n\nBipolar I Disorder: Defined by the presence of at least one full manic episode. Depressive episodes are common but not required for the diagnosis.\n\nBipolar II Disorder: Defined by the presence of at least one hypomanic episode (a less severe form of mania that does not cause major impairment in functioning) AND at least one major depressive episode.\n\nCyclothymic Disorder: A chronic (at least 2 years) condition with numerous periods of hypomanic symptoms and depressive symptoms that are not severe enough to meet the criteria for a full episode.\n\nFuture Question Idea: \"A patient is diagnosed with Bipolar II disorder. The nurse knows that this diagnosis requires a history of which two conditions?\" (Answer: \"At least one hypomanic episode and at least one major depressive episode.\")"

    "question": "A child is consistently ignored and criticized by their caregivers. According to Erik Erikson's psychosocial theory, what is the likely outcome of this negative caregiving during the trust vs. mistrust stage?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Development of a strong sense of identity",
      "B": "Development of a sense of autonomy",
      "C": "Development of a feeling of mistrust and insecurity",
      "D": "Development of industry and competence"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This question tests the application of Erikson's first stage of psychosocial development.\n\nTrust vs. Mistrust (Birth to 18 months): This is the foundational stage of development. The infant is entirely dependent on their caregivers for survival and comfort.\n\nSuccessful Resolution (Trust): If the caregivers are responsive, reliable, and consistent in meeting the infant's needs, the infant develops a fundamental sense of trust in others and the world. The virtue developed is Hope.\n\nUnsuccessful Resolution (Mistrust): If care is inconsistent, unreliable, or rejecting (as described by being \"ignored and criticized\"), the infant develops a sense of mistrust, insecurity, and anxiety. They learn that the world is an unpredictable and dangerous place.\n\nThis early sense of trust or mistrust forms the basis for all future relationships. The other options (A, B, D) correspond to later developmental stages.",

    "question": "A patient is experiencing intense, irrational fears of specific objects or situations. What mental health condition is this individual likely dealing with?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)",
      "B": "Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)",
      "C": "Specific phobia",
      "D": "Major depressive disorder"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The question provides the classic definition of a specific phobia.\n\nSpecific Phobia: An anxiety disorder characterized by a marked, persistent, and excessive or unreasonable fear when in the presence of, or anticipating an encounter with, a specific object or situation.\n\nKey Features:\n\nThe fear is out of proportion to the actual danger posed.\n\nExposure to the phobic stimulus almost invariably provokes an immediate anxiety response (which may take the form of a panic attack).\n\nThe object or situation is actively avoided or endured with intense fear or anxiety.\n\nGAD (B) involves excessive, uncontrollable worry about a number of different things, not a specific object. OCD (A) involves obsessions and compulsions. Depression (D) is a mood disorder.",
    "additional": "ADDITIONAL CONTENT & FUTURE FOCUS (NCK August 2025)\n\n1. Common Types of Specific Phobias:\n\nAnimal Type: e.g., fear of spiders (arachnophobia), snakes, dogs.\n\nNatural Environment Type: e.g., fear of heights (acrophobia), storms, water.\n\nBlood-Injection-Injury (BII) Type: Fear of seeing blood, receiving an injection, or other medical procedures. This type is unique because it often causes a vasovagal response (fainting), whereas other phobias cause a \"fight-or-flight\" response.\n\nSituational Type: e.g., fear of flying, elevators, enclosed spaces (claustrophobia).\n\nOther Type: e.g., fear of choking, vomiting, or clowns.\n\nFuture Question Idea: \"A patient reports an intense fear of receiving injections, and states that they often feel dizzy and faint during blood draws. This presentation is characteristic of which type of specific phobia?\" (Answer: Blood-Injection-Injury type)."
