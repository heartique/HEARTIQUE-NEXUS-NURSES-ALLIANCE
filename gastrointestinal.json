    "question": "When preparing a patient for colonoscopy procedure the nurse should,",
    "options": {
      "A": "Perform a high colonic washout procedure the night before the procedure",
      "B": "Ensure the patient takes a high roughage diet with a laxative the night before procedure",
      "C": "Educate the patient to report any “needle prick” sensations within 12 hrs after the procedure",
      "D": "Advise the patient to take low fiber diet for 1 week before the procedure"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This is a post-procedure instruction, not a preparation step. However, it is the most plausible correct nursing action among the given choices, as the others describe incorrect preparation. This highlights a potential flaw in the question's wording ('When preparing...'). A colonoscopy involves inserting a scope through the entire colon. A rare but serious complication is bowel perforation (a hole poked through the colon wall). The 'needle prick' sensation, along with severe abdominal pain, guarding, rebound tenderness, fever, and tachycardia, could be a sign of perforation. This is a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention. Educating the patient on what to report post-procedure is a critical safety role for the nurse.",
    "additional": "A 'high colonic washout' is not the standard procedure. The standard prep involves drinking a large volume of a polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution (e.g., GoLYTELY, MoviPrep) to cleanse the bowel. Enemas may be used but are not the primary method. A high roughage (high fiber) diet would do the opposite of cleaning the bowel; it would add bulk. Patients are instructed to follow a clear liquid diet for 12-24 hours before the procedure. A low fiber/low residue diet is often recommended for a few days before the procedure begins, but for a whole week is excessive and not standard. The most critical part of the prep is the clear liquid diet and the bowel cleansing solution the day before. Monitor vital signs and for signs of perforation (severe pain, abdominal rigidity, fever). Inform the patient that cramping and significant flatulence are normal as the air insufflated during the procedure is expelled. The patient cannot drive home due to the sedation used (e.g., midazolam, fentanyl).

    "question": "The primary rationales for tube feeding for a client post total laryngectomy due to cancer of larynx is to,",
    "options": {
      "A": "Meet dietary needs and prevent fistula formation",
      "B": "Maintain an open airway and prevent aspiration",
      "C": "Meet fluid & dietary needs and prevent aspiration",
      "D": "Prevent fistula formation and reduce aspiration"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Meet Fluid & Dietary Needs: After a total laryngectomy, the surgical site in the pharynx is very delicate and needs time to heal without the physical trauma of swallowing food. The patient is kept NPO, so a feeding tube (typically a nasogastric or gastrostomy tube) is essential to provide adequate nutrition and hydration, which is vital for healing and recovery. Prevent Aspiration: While a total laryngectomy permanently separates the airway from the esophagus (the patient breathes through a stoma), making aspiration of food into the lungs impossible, there is still a risk of aspiration in the early postoperative period if the swallow mechanism is tested too soon. More importantly, there's a risk of the suture line in the pharynx breaking down, which could lead to wound contamination. Tube feeding completely bypasses the pharyngeal suture line and the swallowing mechanism, preventing any risk of aspiration or stress on the healing tissues. Option (C) covers both the nutritional need and the safety aspect of preventing stress on the healing pharynx, which broadly falls under preventing aspiration/complications.",
    "additional": "Preventing fistula formation (an abnormal opening between the pharynx and the skin) is a key goal, which is achieved by resting the suture line. However, the primary reason for the tube is to provide nutrition that the patient cannot otherwise take. 'Meeting dietary needs' is a more fundamental rationale than preventing a fistula. Also, option (C) is more comprehensive by including both nutrition and safety. The open airway is maintained by the laryngeal stoma, not the feeding tube. Preventing aspiration is correct, but the airway part is wrong. Total Laryngectomy Anatomy: It is crucial to understand that after this surgery, the trachea is brought directly out to the skin of the neck to create a permanent stoma. The GI tract (pharynx and esophagus) is now completely separate from the respiratory tract. The patient can never aspirate food into the lungs again, but they also lose the ability to speak with their vocal cords. Nursing Priorities Post-Laryngectomy: Airway Maintenance: This is #1. Monitor the stoma for patency, provide humidification (to prevent mucus plugs), and perform suctioning as needed. Wound/Drain Care: Monitor for bleeding and signs of infection. Nutrition: Manage tube feedings. Communication: The patient will be unable to speak. Provide alternative means like a whiteboard or picture board. Plan for long-term speech rehabilitation (e.g., electrolarynx, esophageal speech). Psychosocial Support: Address body image changes and the loss of voice.

    "question": "Foods that may predispose a client to megaloblastic anemia if taken exclusively include,",
    "options": {
      "A": "Meat, eggs and beans",
      "B": "Beans, Peas and rice",
      "C": "Capsicum, Sorghum and Millet",
      "D": "Meat, Maize, Sorghum"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Megaloblastic Anemia: Caused by a deficiency of Vitamin B12 or Folic Acid (Folate). These vitamins are essential for DNA synthesis and the proper maturation of red blood cells. Without them, RBCs grow large and abnormal (megaloblasts) and cannot function correctly. Folate Sources: The primary sources of folate are leafy green vegetables, legumes (beans, peas), fruits, and fortified grains. Vitamin B12 Sources: B12 is found almost exclusively in animal products (meat, eggs, dairy).",
    "additional": "Meat: A good source of B12, but a poor source of folate. Maize (Corn) and Sorghum: These are staple grains in many parts of the world, but they are very poor sources of both usable folate and B12. Therefore, a diet consisting exclusively of these three items would be severely deficient in folic acid, leading to megaloblastic anemia. This is a common nutritional problem in populations where unfortified maize is the primary staple food. Meat and eggs provide B12. Beans provide folate. This diet contains sources of both. Beans and peas are excellent sources of folate. While rice is not a great source, the legumes would likely prevent a deficiency. Capsicum (peppers) provide some folate. Sorghum and millet are poor sources. This diet is folate-poor, similar to (D), but the combination in (D) represents a more classic example of a folate-deficient diet seen in specific populations. Differentiating B12 vs. Folate Deficiency: Both cause megaloblastic anemia (fatigue, shortness of breath) and glossitis (sore, beefy red tongue). Only Vitamin B12 deficiency causes neurologic symptoms. This is a critical distinction. The symptoms include paresthesias (numbness/tingling) in the hands and feet and problems with balance and proprioception due to demyelination of the spinal cord. Pernicious Anemia: A specific type of B12 deficiency caused by an autoimmune condition where the stomach does not produce intrinsic factor, a substance necessary to absorb B12 in the ileum. These patients require lifelong B12 injections. Textbook Reference: Brunner & Suddarth's Textbook of Medical-Surgical Nursing, 14th Ed., Chapter 32: Management of Patients With Hematologic Neoplasms. See the section on 'Folic Acid Deficiency' and 'Vitamin B12 Deficiency.'"

    "question": "In pyloric stenosis there is,",
    "options": {
      "A": "Projectile vomiting & olive-sized mass in abdomen’s upper right quadrant",
      "B": "Blood tinged vomitus and significantly reduced peristaltic waves",
      "C": "Severe abdominal pain and irregular opening of the bowels",
      "D": "Normal feeding appetite and passing of loose bowel motion"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Pyloric stenosis is a condition primarily seen in infants (usually between 2 and 8 weeks of age) where the pylorus muscle, the gateway between the stomach and the small intestine, becomes hypertrophied (thickened). This thickening narrows the pyloric canal, obstructing the outflow of stomach contents. This leads to the two classic hallmark signs: Non-bilious Projectile Vomiting: As the stomach fills and cannot empty, peristaltic waves become stronger to try and force the contents through the narrow opening. This results in forceful, projectile vomiting that can shoot several feet. The vomitus contains stomach contents only (no bile), as it has not passed into the duodenum. Palpable 'Olive': The hypertrophied pyloric muscle can often be palpated as a small, hard, mobile, olive-shaped mass in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, especially when the infant's stomach is empty.",
    "additional": "The vomitus is typically not blood-tinged, although some streaks may be present from the force of vomiting irritating the esophagus. Peristaltic waves are often visibly increased across the abdomen as the stomach tries to overcome the obstruction, not reduced. Abdominal pain is not the primary feature; the infant is usually hungry and irritable after vomiting. Bowel movements become infrequent and scant due to the lack of food passing through. The infant has a voracious appetite and wants to feed again immediately after vomiting, but they will have constipation or infrequent stools, not loose bowel motions. Other Clinical Manifestations: Dehydration (sunken fontanels, poor skin turgor, decreased urine output). Weight loss or failure to gain weight despite a good appetite. Metabolic alkalosis (from vomiting stomach acid). Diagnosis: Often made by clinical signs but confirmed with an abdominal ultrasound. Treatment: The definitive treatment is a surgical procedure called a pyloromyotomy, where the surgeon cuts through the thickened muscle to open up the channel. Pre-op Nursing Care: The priority is to correct dehydration and electrolyte imbalances (especially the metabolic alkalosis) with IV fluids. The infant is kept NPO. Textbook Reference: While a pediatric topic, it's often covered in general GI surgery. A dedicated pediatric nursing textbook would have this in detail. For Brunner & Suddarth, this might be found in chapters discussing upper GI disorders, though it is primarily a pediatric diagnosis."

    "question": "Dumping syndrome is as a result of,",
    "options": {
      "A": "Rapid emptying of hypertonic food from the stomach into the jejunum",
      "B": "Failure of a patient with a peptic ulcer to eat regularly",
      "C": "Chronic anemia among the elderly patients",
      "D": "Loss of the large intestine functionality following hemicolectomy"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Dumping syndrome is a common complication following gastric surgery, particularly procedures that remove or bypass the pylorus (the muscular valve that normally controls the rate of stomach emptying), such as a gastrectomy or gastric bypass. Without the pylorus, a large volume of hypertonic (highly concentrated, especially with sugar) food is rapidly 'dumped' from the stomach into the small intestine (jejunum). This causes a two-part reaction: Early Symptoms (15-30 mins post-meal): The hypertonic food in the jejunum causes a rapid fluid shift from the bloodstream into the intestinal lumen to dilute the contents. This leads to intestinal distention and a decrease in circulating blood volume. Symptoms include abdominal cramping, bloating, diarrhea, dizziness, tachycardia, and sweating. Late Symptoms (1-3 hours post-meal): The rapid absorption of a large amount of carbohydrates causes a surge in blood glucose, which triggers an excessive release of insulin. This over-release of insulin then causes rebound hypoglycemia. Symptoms include weakness, sweating, confusion, and shakiness.",
    "additional": "Failure to eat regularly can exacerbate peptic ulcer pain but does not cause dumping syndrome. Chronic anemia is not a cause of dumping syndrome. A hemicolectomy is the removal of part of the large intestine (colon). Dumping syndrome is a problem of the stomach and small intestine. Dietary Management of Dumping Syndrome: This is the cornerstone of treatment and a frequent topic for exam questions. Eat small, frequent meals (6 small meals a day). Eat a diet high in protein and fat, and low in carbohydrates (especially simple sugars). Protein and fat are digested more slowly. Avoid drinking liquids with meals. Drink fluids 30-45 minutes before or after meals. Lie down or recline for 20-30 minutes after eating. This uses gravity to slow the movement of food out of the stomach.

    "question": "Duodenal ulcers,",
    "options": {
      "A": "Are more common in people above 50 years",
      "B": "Are more common in females than males",
      "C": "Have a higher risk of malignancy than gastric ulcers",
      "D": "Pain is commonly experienced 3 hours after meals."
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This is the classic distinguishing feature of a duodenal ulcer. The pain typically occurs 2 to 3 hours after a meal. This is because eating food causes the release of bicarbonate into the duodenum to neutralize the stomach acid that is passed along. This bicarbonate temporarily buffers the ulcer, so the pain goes away. A few hours later, when the buffering effect wears off and the stomach is secreting more acid in response to the meal, the pain returns. For this reason, eating food often relieves the pain of a duodenal ulcer. The pain also frequently awakens the patient at night.",
    "additional": "Duodenal ulcers are actually most common in a younger age group, typically 30-60 years old. Gastric ulcers are more common in people over 50. Duodenal ulcers are more common in males than females. Gastric ulcers have a higher risk of being malignant (cancerous). Duodenal ulcers are almost never malignant. Duodenal vs. Gastric Ulcers: Know the key differences. | Feature | Duodenal Ulcer | Gastric Ulcer | | :--- | :--- | :--- | | Pain Timing | 2-3 hours after meals; at night | 30-60 mins after meals; during the day | | Effect of Food| Pain RELIEVED by eating | Pain WORSENED by eating | | Vomiting | Uncommon | Common | | Hemorrhage | More likely: Melena (black, tarry stools) | More likely: Hematemesis (vomiting blood) | | Malignancy| Rare | Possible | Causes of Peptic Ulcer Disease (PUD): Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection: The most common cause. NSAID use: Chronic use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (aspirin, ibuprofen) damages the gastric mucosa. Treatment: Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) like omeprazole to reduce acid, and antibiotics to eradicate H. pylori.

    "question": "Cholelithiasis is associated with:",
    "options": {
      "A": "Abnormal metabolism of cholesterol and bile salts.",
      "B": "Abnormal metabolism of lipids and bile acids.",
      "C": "Chronic pancreatitis.",
      "D": "Hepatitis."
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Cholelithiasis is the medical term for the formation of gallstones in the gallbladder. Bile, which is produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder, is made of water, electrolytes, bile salts, cholesterol, and bilirubin. Gallstones form when there is an imbalance in these components. The most common type of gallstone is the cholesterol stone. These form when the bile becomes 'supersaturated' with cholesterol. This occurs when the liver secretes too much cholesterol, or when there are not enough bile salts to keep the cholesterol dissolved. The cholesterol then crystallizes and hardens into stones. This is a direct result of the abnormal metabolism of cholesterol and bile salts.",
    "additional": "Option (A) is more specific and accurate than (B). While cholesterol is a lipid, 'bile salts' is more precise than 'bile acids.' Chronic pancreatitis can be a result of gallstones (if a stone blocks the common bile duct and pancreatic duct), but it is not the cause of cholelithiasis. Hepatitis can affect bile production, but is not the primary cause. Risk Factors for Cholelithiasis (the '4 Fs'): Female, Forty (age > 40), Fat (obesity), Fertile (multiparous, use of estrogen). Types of Gallstones: Cholesterol Stones (~80%), yellow-green. Pigment Stones (bilirubin), associated with hemolytic conditions or cirrhosis. Clinical Manifestations: Often asymptomatic. Biliary Colic: Episodic, severe RUQ pain radiating to right shoulder/back, especially after fatty meals. Cholecystitis: Inflammation of the gallbladder with fever and Murphy’s sign. Treatment: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Textbook Reference: Brunner & Suddarth’s Textbook of Medical-Surgical Nursing, 14th Ed., Chapter 40: Management of Patients With Biliary Disorders."

    "question": "The teeth that commonly get impacted are the:",
    "options": {
      "A": "Molars.",
      "B": "Incisors.",
      "C": "Canine.",
      "D": "Wisdom."
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "An impacted tooth is one that fails to fully erupt through the gums and into its proper position, often because there is not enough space in the jaw. The wisdom teeth, also known as third molars, are the last to erupt (typically between ages 17 and 25). By this time, the jaw has often stopped growing and may lack space, making wisdom teeth the most commonly impacted.",
    "additional": "Option (A) is vague; while wisdom teeth are molars, 'Wisdom' is the more specific answer. (B) and (C): Incisors and canines erupt early and are less commonly impacted. The maxillary canines are second most likely to be impacted, but far less than wisdom teeth. Complications of Impacted Wisdom Teeth: Pain and swelling, infection (pericoronitis), damage to adjacent teeth, cyst formation around the crown. Treatment: Surgical extraction. Nursing Care Post-Extraction: Bleeding control (gauze), pain/swelling management (ice/analgesics), dietary instructions (soft food, no straws).

      "C": "Take history and ask for history of allergic reactions to barium",
      "D": "Alert the doctor if the patient had severe vomiting"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "A barium meal (upper GI series) is an X-ray procedure used to visualize the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. The patient drinks a chalky liquid containing barium sulfate. Severe vomiting is a significant finding to report because it may indicate gastric outlet obstruction, which is a contraindication. Also, the patient may be unable to retain the contrast, making the procedure unfeasible. Alerting the doctor ensures patient safety.",
    "additional": "Incorrect Options: (A) Positioning is done by the radiology team during the test. (B) A full head-to-toe exam is not required before this diagnostic test. (C) Barium sulfate allergies are extremely rare. While asking for allergy history is good practice, it’s not critical here. Pre-procedure Instructions: NPO for 8–12 hours before test. Avoid smoking or chewing gum. Post-procedure Instructions: Encourage fluid intake, explain white/clay-colored stool for 24–72 hours, use of laxatives to prevent constipation.
