    "Community & PHC are the Foundation: The overwhelming majority of questions are set within the context of Community Health and Primary Health Care (PHC). You must understand the principles, terminology, and application of these fields.",
    "The Nurse as a Leader, Educator, and Researcher: The units on Management, Research, and Teaching Methodology are heavily tested. These are not theoretical; they are practical questions about the nurse's role in leading teams, understanding and conducting research, and educating others.",
    "Key Populations and Programs are Central: A huge number of questions focus on Mothers and Children. This makes Family Planning, Growth & Development, and Immunization (KEPI) critically important units.",
    "Psychiatry is a Major Clinical Unit: This is the most significant clinical specialty tested in Paper 2, covering disorders, priority interventions, and therapeutic communication."
