    "option_c": "Moderate to severe hypotension",
    "option_d": "Polyuria",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The hallmark signs of acute glomerulonephritis are generalized oedema, hypertension, hematuria, and oliguria due to glomerular inflammation and sodium/water retention. Option A is correct. Green-tinged urine (B) is not typical—it is more suggestive of medication effect or bile pigment. Hypotension (C) is not expected; patients are often hypertensive. Polyuria (D) is unlikely, as reduced urine output is common.",
    "additional": "High-yield note: Always associate glomerulonephritis with the triad of hematuria, oedema, and hypertension. NCK tip: watch for post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis questions—common in children after throat or skin infections. Mnemonic: 'PHO' (Proteinuria, Hematuria, Oedema). Prediction: Questions may test the difference between nephritic and nephrotic syndrome—nephritic = blood in urine + hypertension; nephrotic = massive proteinuria + oedema + hypoalbuminemia."

    "option_c": "Shallow respirations",
    "option_d": "Tachypnea",
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "In metabolic acidosis, the body compensates through respiratory mechanisms—tachypnea (rapid breathing) to blow off CO₂ (Kussmaul respirations). Therefore, option D is correct. WBC count (A) and platelet count (B) are unrelated. Shallow respirations (C) would worsen acidosis instead of compensating for it.",
    "additional": "High-yield note: Remember the compensation formula—Metabolic Acidosis → Respiratory Alkalosis (via hyperventilation). NCK prediction: Expect exam questions on dehydration in infants (sunken fontanelle, poor skin turgor, dry mucous membranes). Mnemonic: 'MUDPILES' for metabolic acidosis causes (Methanol, Uremia, DKA, Paracetamol, Iron/INH, Lactic acidosis, Ethylene glycol, Salicylates).

    "option_c": "Obtaining history information from the parents",
    "option_d": "Orienting the parents to the paediatric unit",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Meningococcal meningitis is highly contagious and transmitted via respiratory droplets. The FIRST nursing priority is instituting droplet precautions to protect others. Acetaminophen (B) for fever and comfort, history-taking (C), and orientation (D) are important but secondary.",
    "additional": "High-yield note: Always prioritize infection control in meningitis. NCK tip: know the difference between droplet, airborne, and contact precautions. Mnemonic: 'SPIDERMAN' for droplet precautions (Sepsis, Pneumonia, Influenza, Diphtheria, Epiglottitis, Rubella, Meningitis, Adenovirus, mumps).

    "option_d": "Ensure that chemotherapy doesn’t adversely affect the bone marrow",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Allopurinol reduces uric acid production by inhibiting xanthine oxidase. It prevents hyperuricemia and uric acid stone formation during chemotherapy, when massive cell lysis occurs. Option A is correct. It does not prevent bleeding (B), does not enhance uric acid production (C—it reduces it), and has no effect on bone marrow suppression (D).",
    "additional": "High-yield note: Tumor lysis syndrome is a critical complication in leukemia treatment—hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia. Allopurinol is preventive. Prediction: NCK may ask about other tumor lysis management strategies like aggressive hydration or rasburicase. Clinical pearl: Always monitor uric acid and renal function during chemotherapy."

    "option_d": "History of steroid-dependent asthma",
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "A history of steroid-dependent asthma suggests severe, difficult-to-control asthma and predicts a higher risk of life-threatening exacerbations. Option D is correct. O₂ sat of 95% (A) is within normal limits. Mild work of breathing (B) and absence of retractions (C) indicate mild disease.",
    "additional": "High-yield note: Always stratify asthma severity based on history and current signs. NCK pearl: Steroid-dependent or previous ICU admission = red flag. Mnemonic for asthma risk factors: 'PRIME' (Previous ICU, Refractory symptoms, Intubation history, Medication dependence, Exacerbations frequent).
