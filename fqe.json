    "question": "Fetal axis pressure is a physical change that is more significant during:-",
    "options": {
      "A": "Early stages of labour transmitting the force of contraction to the upper pole of fetus.",
      "B": "Second stage of labour when membranes are intact.",
      "C": "Active and second stages of labour when membranes are ruptured.",
      "D": "Second stage of labour transmitting the force of contraction to the lower pole of the uterus."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Fetal axis pressure is the transmission of the force of uterine contractions from the fundus (top of the uterus), down the long axis of the fetus, and applied to the presenting part. This pressure is most effective and significant in causing cervical effacement and dilatation, as well as the descent of the fetus, once the membranes have ruptured. With intact membranes, the force is dissipated somewhat by the amniotic fluid. The active phase and the second stage are when contractions are strongest and most effective.",
    "additional": "The mechanisms of labor involve a series of passive movements of the fetus as it passes through the birth canal. Key factors include the 'three Ps': Powers (uterine contractions and maternal pushing efforts), Passage (the bony pelvis and soft tissues), and Passenger (the fetus and placenta). Fetal axis pressure is a critical component of the 'Powers'. For the Nursing Council of Kenya (NCK) exams, it is important to understand how abnormalities in any of the 'three Ps' can lead to dystocia (difficult labor). For instance, poor uterine contractions (uterine inertia), a small pelvis (cephalopelvic disproportion), or an abnormal fetal position (malpresentation) can all impede the progress of labor."

    "question": "A client with a fractured femur is at risk for fat embolism syndrome. Which symptom is most indicative of this condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Petechiae on the chest and conjunctiva",
      "B": "Severe localized pain at the fracture site",
      "C": "Cool, pale extremity distal to fracture",
      "D": "Decreased deep tendon reflexes"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Fat embolism syndrome (FES) is a serious complication of long bone fractures, particularly the femur. It occurs when fat globules are released from the bone marrow into the bloodstream. The classic triad of symptoms for FES includes respiratory distress, neurological changes, and a petechial rash. The petechial rash, which appears on the chest, axillae, and conjunctiva, is caused by the occlusion of small capillaries by fat emboli and is a hallmark sign of the condition.",
    "additional": "While severe pain is expected with a fracture, and a cool, pale extremity might suggest compartment syndrome or arterial injury, the petechial rash is highly specific to FES. Other signs include sudden onset of dyspnea, confusion, and restlessness. Nursing management focuses on early recognition, immobilization of the fracture to prevent further fat release, respiratory support, and maintaining hemodynamic stability. NCK questions often focus on differentiating between complications of fractures, such as FES, compartment syndrome, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT)."

    "question": "At primary level of ant-retroviral prophylaxis for PMTCT (prevention of mother to child transmission), a HIV-positive woman should take:",
    "options": {
      "A": "Nevirapine 300 mgs at onset of labour.",
      "B": "Nevirapine 200 mgs at onset of labour.",
      "C": "Zidovudine 300 mgs 3 hourly at the onset of labour for 12-24 hours and a single dose Nevirapine.",
      "D": "Zidovudine 2mg/ kilogram body weight within three days of delivery."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This question refers to an older regimen for PMTCT. Historically, intrapartum Zidovudine (AZT) combined with a single dose of Nevirapine for the mother and infant was a common and effective strategy. Zidovudine works by reducing the maternal viral load, and Nevirapine provides additional protection for the baby during delivery.",
    "additional": "Current WHO and Kenyan guidelines for PMTCT have evolved. The current standard of care is to have all pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV on a lifelong combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) regimen, regardless of their CD4 count. A preferred first-line regimen often includes Tenofovir, Lamivudine, and Dolutegravir (TLD). This 'Treat All' approach is the most effective way to suppress the maternal viral load to undetectable levels, which is the primary goal for preventing transmission to the baby. For NCK exams, candidates should be familiar with the latest national PMTCT guidelines."

    "question": "Perineal trauma is common in delivery of face to pubis due to:",
    "options": {
      "A": "Irregular shape of the face as a presenting part.",
      "B": "Persistent occipital-posterior position when occiput becomes the leading part.",
      "C": "Large presenting mentovertical diameter.",
      "D": "Large presenting submento bregmatic (9.5cm) and bi-temporal diameters."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "A face-to-pubis delivery is a type of malpresentation where the fetal head is extended rather than flexed. In this position, the presenting diameter is the mentovertical (from the chin to the vertex), which is approximately 13.5 cm. This is the largest diameter of the fetal skull and significantly distends the perineum as it emerges, leading to a high likelihood of severe perineal tears.",
    "additional": "In a normal delivery, the fetal head is well-flexed, and the presenting diameter is the suboccipitobregmatic (approximately 9.5 cm), which is much smaller and passes through the pelvis more easily. Understanding fetal diameters and presentations is crucial for anticipating and managing complications during labor. A face presentation can sometimes be delivered vaginally if the chin is anterior (mento-anterior), but if the chin is posterior (mento-posterior), vaginal delivery is impossible, and a caesarean section is required."

    "question": "Which symptom is most indicative of hypocalcemia?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Muscle weakness and lethargy",
      "B": "Positive Trousseau's and Chvostek's signs",
      "C": "Dry, flushed skin",
      "D": "Hyperactive bowel sounds"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Hypocalcemia (low calcium levels in the blood) leads to increased neuromuscular excitability. Chvostek's sign is twitching of the facial muscles in response to tapping over the area of the facial nerve. Trousseau's sign is a carpopedal spasm that results from inflating a blood pressure cuff to a level above systolic pressure for 3 minutes. These two signs are classic indicators of latent tetany caused by hypocalcemia.",
    "additional": "Muscle weakness and lethargy are more characteristic of hypercalcemia. Dry, flushed skin can be a sign of dehydration or hyperglycemia. While hypocalcemia can cause abdominal cramping and diarrhea (leading to hyperactive bowel sounds), Trousseau's and Chvostek's signs are more specific. NCK exams frequently test on electrolyte imbalances, so it is important to know the signs, symptoms, causes, and nursing management for imbalances of sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium."

    "question": "A client is prescribed warfarin. Which food should the nurse advise the client to avoid?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Apples",
      "B": "Leafy green vegetables",
      "C": "Bananas",
      "D": "Dairy products"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Warfarin is an anticoagulant that works by inhibiting the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. Leafy green vegetables, such as spinach, kale, and broccoli, are high in vitamin K. Consuming large or inconsistent amounts of these vegetables can counteract the effect of warfarin, making it less effective and increasing the risk of blood clots.",
    "additional": "The key advice for patients on warfarin is to maintain a consistent intake of vitamin K. They do not have to avoid these foods entirely, but they should not make sudden, large changes in their consumption. Patient education is a critical nursing role and includes teaching about the importance of regular INR (International Normalized Ratio) monitoring to ensure the warfarin dose is therapeutic. Other foods and substances that can interact with warfarin include cranberry juice, alcohol, and certain antibiotics."

    "question": "Possible signs of pregnancy include:",
    "options": {
      "A": "Human gonadotrophin hormones in urine, amenorrhea",
      "B": "Braxton hicks contractions, amenorrhea"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Signs of pregnancy are categorized into three groups: presumptive, probable, and positive.\n\nPresumptive signs are subjective changes felt by the woman (e.g., amenorrhea, nausea, fatigue).\n\nProbable signs are objective changes observed by an examiner (e.g., Braxton Hicks contractions, a positive pregnancy test, ballottement, Hegar's sign).\n\nPositive signs are those that confirm the presence of a fetus (e.g., fetal heart sounds, visualization of the fetus by ultrasound, fetal movement palpated by an examiner).\n\nAmenorrhea is a presumptive sign. Braxton Hicks contractions are a probable sign. The presence of hCG in urine is also a probable sign. The combination in option B (a probable and a presumptive sign) fits the category of 'possible' (or more accurately, probable/presumptive) signs.",
    "additional": "For NCK exams, it is vital to be able to differentiate between presumptive, probable, and positive signs of pregnancy. A positive pregnancy test (hCG in urine or blood) is a probable sign, not a positive one, because conditions other than pregnancy (like a hydatidiform mole) can also cause elevated hCG levels. Only the absolute confirmation of a fetus constitutes a positive sign."
