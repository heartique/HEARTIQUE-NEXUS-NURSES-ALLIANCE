    "question": "The causes of pre-renal failure include,",
    "options": {
      "A": "Renal caliculi, benign prostatic hypertrophy and blood clots",
      "B": "Tubular necrosis, septic shock and hemolytic blood reaction transfusion",
      "C": "Hemorrhage, burns and dehydration",
      "D": "Tumours, Trauma and chemical toxicity"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Rationale for Correct Answer (C): Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is categorized into three types based on the location of the problem: pre-renal, intra-renal (or intrinsic), and post-renal.\n\nPre-renal AKI is caused by any condition that reduces blood flow (perfusion) to the kidneys. The kidneys themselves are initially healthy, but they are not receiving enough blood to filter. The causes listed in option (C) are classic examples of conditions that lead to severe volume depletion and decreased perfusion:\n\nHemorrhage: Loss of blood volume.\nBurns: Massive fluid loss through damaged skin (\"third-spacing\").\nDehydration: Insufficient fluid volume.\n\nOther common pre-renal causes include heart failure (the pump fails to send blood forward), septic shock (massive vasodilation), and severe hypotension from any cause.\n\nAnalysis of Incorrect Options:\n\n(A) Renal calculi (kidney stones), benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH), and blood clots are all causes of Post-renal AKI. This type is caused by an obstruction in the urinary tract after the kidney, which prevents urine from draining. The backup of urine creates pressure that damages the kidneys.\n\n(B) & (D) Tubular necrosis, septic shock, hemolytic blood reaction, and chemical toxicity (nephrotoxins) are all causes of Intra-renal (Intrinsic) AKI. This type is caused by direct damage to the kidney tissue itself (the glomeruli or tubules). Septic shock is unique because it can cause both pre-renal (from hypotension) and intra-renal (from endotoxin damage) injury.",
    "additional": "Memorize the Categories of AKI: This is a fundamental concept.\n\nPre-renal: Problem is Perfusion (e.g., hemorrhage, heart failure, dehydration).\nIntra-renal: Problem is the Kidney itself (e.g., nephrotoxic drugs like gentamicin, contrast dye; glomerulonephritis; acute tubular necrosis).\nPost-renal: Problem is Obstruction (e.g., BPH, kidney stones, tumors).\n\nAssessment: In pre-renal AKI, the nurse will see signs of volume depletion (hypotension, tachycardia) and a very low urine output (oliguria).\n\nTreatment: The treatment for pre-renal AKI is to restore perfusion to the kidney by treating the underlying cause (e.g., giving IV fluids for dehydration, blood for hemorrhage). If perfusion is restored promptly, the kidney function usually recovers.\n\nTextbook Reference: Brunner & Suddarth's Textbook of Medical-Surgical Nursing, 14th Ed., Chapter 44: Management of Patients With Kidney Disorders.

    "question": "For a patient to undergoing a kidney, ureter and bladder X-ray is important for the nurse to know that,",
    "options": {
      "A": "There is no special preparation required.",
      "B": "Oral fluids must be withheld the morning of the examination.",
      "C": "The patient should have a full bladder before the procedure.",
      "D": "An enema should be administered before the procedure"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Rationale for Correct Answer (A): A KUB (Kidney, Ureter, Bladder) X-ray is a plain abdominal radiograph. It is a simple, non-invasive diagnostic test used as a preliminary screening tool to visualize the size, shape, and position of the kidneys and to detect obvious abnormalities like very large kidney stones (renal calculi) or masses. Because it is a basic X-ray and does not involve contrast dye or visualization of function, there is no special preparation required. The patient does not need to be NPO, does not need a full or empty bladder, and does not require a bowel prep.\n\nAnalysis of Incorrect Options:\n\n(B) Withholding fluids is not necessary for a KUB. It would be required for procedures involving anesthesia or certain types of contrast.\n\n(C) A full bladder is required for a pelvic ultrasound, as it pushes the bowel out of the way and provides a clear \"acoustic window\" to visualize the uterus, ovaries, or bladder itself. It is not required for a KUB X-ray.\n\n(D) An enema or other bowel preparation is required for procedures where bowel gas or contents could obscure the view of the target organs, such as an intravenous pyelogram (IVP) or a colonoscopy. It is not required for a routine KUB.",

    "question": "Turbid urine is an indication of;",
    "options": {
      "A": "a. Dehydration and urinary tract infection.",
      "B": "b. Presence of prostatic fluid and WBC.",
      "C": "c. Anuria and presence of RBCs.",
      "D": "d. Perineal injury and prolonged use of diuretics"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Rationale for Correct Answer (A): Turbid means cloudy or hazy.\n\nUrinary Tract Infection (UTI): This is the most common pathological cause of turbid urine. The cloudiness is caused by the presence of bacteria and white blood cells (pyuria) that have accumulated in response to the infection.\n\nDehydration: When a person is dehydrated, their urine becomes highly concentrated. This concentration can cause normal solutes, such as phosphates or urates, to precipitate out of the solution, making the urine appear cloudy.\n\nTherefore, turbid urine can indicate either a benign condition like dehydration or a pathological one like a UTI.\n\nAnalysis of Incorrect Options:\n\n(B) The presence of WBCs is correct (it's a sign of a UTI), but prostatic fluid is not a common cause of turbidity. While option (A) includes UTI, it also correctly includes dehydration, a very common non-pathological cause.\n\n(C) Anuria is the absence of urine production (<50 mL/day). If there is no urine, its clarity cannot be assessed. The presence of RBCs (hematuria) would make the urine look pink, red, or brown, not just turbid.\n\n(D) Perineal injury might cause hematuria. Prolonged use of diuretics would typically cause dilute, clear urine, not turbid urine.",
