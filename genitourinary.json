    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Rationale for Correct Answer (C): Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is categorized into three types based on the location of the problem: pre-renal, intra-renal (or intrinsic), and post-renal.\n\nPre-renal AKI is caused by any condition that reduces blood flow (perfusion) to the kidneys. The kidneys themselves are initially healthy, but they are not receiving enough blood to filter. The causes listed in option (C) are classic examples of conditions that lead to severe volume depletion and decreased perfusion:\n\nHemorrhage: Loss of blood volume.\nBurns: Massive fluid loss through damaged skin (\"third-spacing\").\nDehydration: Insufficient fluid volume.\n\nOther common pre-renal causes include heart failure (the pump fails to send blood forward), septic shock (massive vasodilation), and severe hypotension from any cause.\n\nAnalysis of Incorrect Options:\n\n(A) Renal calculi (kidney stones), benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH), and blood clots are all causes of Post-renal AKI. This type is caused by an obstruction in the urinary tract after the kidney, which prevents urine from draining. The backup of urine creates pressure that damages the kidneys.\n\n(B) & (D) Tubular necrosis, septic shock, hemolytic blood reaction, and chemical toxicity (nephrotoxins) are all causes of Intra-renal (Intrinsic) AKI. This type is caused by direct damage to the kidney tissue itself (the glomeruli or tubules). Septic shock is unique because it can cause both pre-renal (from hypotension) and intra-renal (from endotoxin damage) injury.",
    "additional": "Memorize the Categories of AKI: This is a fundamental concept.\n\nPre-renal: Problem is Perfusion (e.g., hemorrhage, heart failure, dehydration).\nIntra-renal: Problem is the Kidney itself (e.g., nephrotoxic drugs like gentamicin, contrast dye; glomerulonephritis; acute tubular necrosis).\nPost-renal: Problem is Obstruction (e.g., BPH, kidney stones, tumors).\n\nAssessment: In pre-renal AKI, the nurse will see signs of volume depletion (hypotension, tachycardia) and a very low urine output (oliguria).\n\nTreatment: The treatment for pre-renal AKI is to restore perfusion to the kidney by treating the underlying cause (e.g., giving IV fluids for dehydration, blood for hemorrhage). If perfusion is restored promptly, the kidney function usually recovers.\n\nTextbook Reference: Brunner & Suddarth's Textbook of Medical-Surgical Nursing, 14th Ed., Chapter 44: Management of Patients With Kidney Disorders.

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Rationale for Correct Answer (A): A KUB (Kidney, Ureter, Bladder) X-ray is a plain abdominal radiograph. It is a simple, non-invasive diagnostic test used as a preliminary screening tool to visualize the size, shape, and position of the kidneys and to detect obvious abnormalities like very large kidney stones (renal calculi) or masses. Because it is a basic X-ray and does not involve contrast dye or visualization of function, there is no special preparation required. The patient does not need to be NPO, does not need a full or empty bladder, and does not require a bowel prep.\n\nAnalysis of Incorrect Options:\n\n(B) Withholding fluids is not necessary for a KUB. It would be required for procedures involving anesthesia or certain types of contrast.\n\n(C) A full bladder is required for a pelvic ultrasound, as it pushes the bowel out of the way and provides a clear \"acoustic window\" to visualize the uterus, ovaries, or bladder itself. It is not required for a KUB X-ray.\n\n(D) An enema or other bowel preparation is required for procedures where bowel gas or contents could obscure the view of the target organs, such as an intravenous pyelogram (IVP) or a colonoscopy.

    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Rationale for Correct Answer (A): Turbid means cloudy or hazy.\n\nUrinary Tract Infection (UTI): This is the most common pathological cause of turbid urine. The cloudiness is caused by the presence of bacteria and white blood cells (pyuria) that have accumulated in response to the infection.\n\nDehydration: When a person is dehydrated, their urine becomes highly concentrated. This concentration can cause normal solutes, such as phosphates or urates, to precipitate out of the solution, making the urine appear cloudy.\n\nTherefore, turbid urine can indicate either a benign condition like dehydration or a pathological one like a UTI.\n\nAnalysis of Incorrect Options:\n\n(B) The presence of WBCs is correct (it's a sign of a UTI), but prostatic fluid is not a common cause of turbidity. While option (A) includes UTI, it also correctly includes dehydration, a very common non-pathological cause.\n\n(C) Anuria is the absence of urine production (<50 mL/day). If there is no urine, its clarity cannot be assessed. The presence of RBCs (hematuria) would make the urine look pink, red, or brown, not just turbid.\n\n(D) Perineal injury might cause hematuria.

    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Background: Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is categorized based on its cause:\n\nPre-renal: The problem is \"before\" the kidneys. It's caused by a sudden and severe drop in blood flow (perfusion) to the kidneys. The kidneys themselves are initially healthy.\n\nIntra-renal (or Intrinsic): The problem is \"inside\" the kidneys. It's caused by direct damage to the kidney tissue (e.g., glomeruli, tubules).\n\nPost-renal: The problem is \"after\" the kidneys. It's caused by an obstruction of urine flow from the kidneys.\n\n(C) Why it's correct: This option lists classic causes of severe volume depletion, which leads to decreased blood flow to the kidneys.\n\nHemorrhage: Massive blood loss leads to hypovolemia and hypotension.\n\nBurns: Extensive burns cause a massive fluid shift out of the vascular space, leading to hypovolemia.\n\nDehydration: Severe dehydration from vomiting, diarrhea, or inadequate intake reduces circulating volume.\nAll these conditions result in poor renal perfusion, causing pre-renal AKI.\n\n(A) Why it's incorrect: Renal calculi (kidney stones), benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH), and blood clots in the ureters are all causes of post-renal failure, as they obstruct urine outflow.\n\n(B) Why it's incorrect: Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is a cause of intra-renal failure. A hemolytic transfusion reaction and nephrotoxic drugs also cause direct damage to the tubules (intra-renal). Septic shock can initially cause pre-renal failure due to massive vasodilation, but prolonged ischemia and toxins can lead to it becoming intra-renal (ATN).\n\n(D) Why it's incorrect: Tumors can cause post-renal failure if they obstruct the ureters. Trauma and chemical toxicity (nephrotoxins) cause direct damage to the kidneys, which is intra-renal failure.",

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Note: The question is slightly ambiguous as it could refer to a simple KUB X-ray or a more complex procedure like an IVP. Let's analyze it from the perspective of a standard KUB (Kidney, Ureter, Bladder) X-ray. The answer key highlights (C), which is incorrect for a KUB. Let's re-analyze.\n\nRe-analysis and Correction:\nA standard KUB X-ray requires no special preparation. However, an ultrasound of the bladder or pelvis often requires a full bladder to act as an acoustic window. An Intravenous Pyelogram (IVP) requires a bowel prep. The question is most likely flawed.\n\nLet's evaluate the options based on what is most likely being tested.\n\n(A) No special prep: This is true for a KUB.\n\n(B) Withhold fluids: This is done for procedures with contrast or sedation, but not a simple KUB.\n\n(C) Full bladder: This is required for a pelvic/bladder ultrasound, not an X-ray. A full bladder on an X-ray just shows up as a large white area.\n\n(D) Enema: This is often required for an Intravenous Pyelogram (IVP) to clear gas and stool that could obscure the view of the kidneys.\n\nConclusion: The question is poorly written. If it means a KUB, the answer is (A). If it means an IVP, the answer is (D). If it means an ultrasound, the answer is (C). Given that an enema is a common prep for visualizing the urinary system on imaging, let's select that as a plausible intended answer for a study more complex than a simple KUB. However, if we must choose from the provided options and assume it's the most common imaging, which is an ultrasound, the intended answer might be (C). This highlights the importance of recognizing flawed questions.",
    "additional": "Expanded Rationale (for Ultrasound):\n\n(C) Why it's correct (for Ultrasound): A full bladder provides an \"acoustic window,\" pushing the intestines out of the way and creating a clear path for the ultrasound waves to visualize the bladder walls and other pelvic organs like the uterus or prostate. The patient is typically instructed to drink several glasses of water an hour before the test and not to urinate."

      "D": "Permeability of the kidney tubules increases with oliguria"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "(B) Why it's correct: This accurately describes the initial systemic response to a major burn. Inflammatory mediators released from the burn site cause widespread vasodilation and a dramatic increase in capillary permeability. This leads to a massive fluid shift from the intravascular space into the interstitial space (edema). This loss of circulating volume causes hypovolemia and hypotension, which in turn leads to reduced blood flow to the kidneys (pre-renal state) and other vital organs.\n\n(A) Why it's incorrect: According to the Rule of Nines in an adult, the entire arm (front and back) is 9%. The entire leg (front and back) is 18%. This statement has the values reversed.\n\n(C) Why it's incorrect: The fluid shifts from the intravascular compartment (part of the ECF) to the interstitial compartment (also part of the ECF). The major electrolyte shift is that damaged cells lyse and release large amounts of potassium into the extracellular fluid, causing hyperkalemia. So the potassium part is correct, but the ICF to ECF shift is less precise than intravascular to interstitial.\n\n(D) Why it's incorrect: Oliguria (decreased urine output) is a result of the decreased renal blood flow. It doesn't cause a change in the permeability of the kidney tubules. If the shock state persists, it can lead to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), which does involve damage to the tubules, but the initial event is decreased perfusion.",

    "question": "The nurse plans care for a client diagnosed with end stage renal disease (ESRD). Which findings does the nurse expect to find in the client's medical record?",

      "a": "Edema",
      "b": "Anemia",
      "c": "Hypotension",

    },
    "answer": "a, b, d",
    "explanation": "The most encompassing and universal findings are Edema, Anemia, and Hypocalcemia. Hypotension is incorrect.\n\nEdema (Correct): In ESRD, the kidneys fail to excrete sodium and water, leading to fluid volume excess. This manifests as peripheral edema, pulmonary edema, and hypertension.\n\nAnemia (Correct): The kidneys produce the hormone erythropoietin, which stimulates the bone marrow to produce red blood cells (RBCs). In ESRD, erythropoietin production ceases, leading to profound chronic anemia.\n\nHypotension (Incorrect): This is wrong. The vast majority of ESRD patients suffer from hypertension due to fluid overload and the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Hypotension might occur during dialysis if too much fluid is removed too quickly, but it is not a characteristic finding of the disease state itself.\n\nHypocalcemia (Correct): The kidneys are responsible for activating Vitamin D, which is necessary for calcium absorption from the gut. In ESRD, inactive Vitamin D leads to decreased calcium absorption, causing hypocalcemia. This, in turn, stimulates the parathyroid gland, leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism and renal osteodystrophy.",
    "additional": "Conclusion: The question is flawed if it expects a single answer. A, B, and D are all expected findings. C is the opposite of what is expected. If we must choose the answer that is most uniquely \"renal,\" it would be (b) Anemia or (d) Hypocalcemia, as these are direct results of the kidney's lost endocrine/metabolic functions. However, (a) Edema is the most visible and common clinical sign. The provided answer key's choice (C) is definitively incorrect."

      "b": "Just before dialysis",
      "c": "The day after dialysis",
      "d": "Upon return from dialysis"
    },
    "answer": "d",
    "explanation": "Correct (d): Enalapril is an ACE inhibitor, an antihypertensive medication. Hemodialysis removes a large volume of fluid from the blood, which typically causes a significant drop in blood pressure. Administering an antihypertensive before or during dialysis would exacerbate this hypotension, putting the patient at risk for dizziness, syncope, or circulatory collapse. Therefore, it is standard practice to hold most antihypertensive medications before a dialysis session and administer them after the treatment is complete, once the patient's post-dialysis blood pressure is stable.\n\nIncorrect (a, b): Administering the medication during or just before dialysis would lead to profound hypotension. Additionally, many medications, including some blood pressure drugs, are \"dialyzed off\" (removed from the blood by the dialysis machine), rendering the dose ineffective.\n\nIncorrect (c): Waiting until the next day would mean the patient misses a scheduled dose, potentially leading to poorly controlled hypertension in the period between dialysis sessions.",
    "additional": "Deeper Insight: The nurse must always review a dialysis patient's medication list and collaborate with the nephrology team or dialysis unit staff about which medications to hold before treatment. Commonly held medications include antihypertensives, certain antibiotics, and water-soluble vitamins, as they will be removed by the dialysis process.\n\nPossible Next Question (NCK Focus): \"Which class of medications should the nurse plan to hold for a client prior to a scheduled hemodialysis treatment?\" The answer would be Antihypertensives. Another possible question: \"A client returning from hemodialysis has a blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg. Which action should the nurse take first?\" The answer would be to recheck the blood pressure before administering any scheduled antihypertensive medications."

      "a": "Take blood pressures only on the right arm to ensure accuracy",
      "b": "Use the fistula for all venipunctures and intravenous infusions",

      "d": "Assess the fistula for the presence of a bruit and thrill every 4 hours"
    },
    "answer": "d",
    "explanation": "Correct (d): An AV fistula is a surgical connection between an artery and a vein, creating a high-flow access point for dialysis. The \"lifeline\" for a dialysis patient is their access site. Assessing its patency is a top priority. A patent, functioning fistula has a bruit (a \"whooshing\" sound heard with a stethoscope) and a thrill (a vibrating or buzzing sensation felt on palpation). The nurse must assess for these at least every 4 hours to ensure the fistula has not clotted.\n\nIncorrect (a): This is dangerous and incorrect. Taking blood pressure on the fistula arm can create pressure high enough to damage or clot the fistula. All blood pressures, IV insertions, and venipunctures must be performed on the non-fistula arm.\n\nIncorrect (b): The fistula is exclusively for hemodialysis access. It should never be used for routine venipuncture or IV infusions, as this can lead to infection or clotting.\n\nIncorrect (c): Clamps are kept at the bedside for emergencies (e.g., if a dialysis catheter disconnects), but they are not attached to the dressing of an AV fistula. Clamping the fistula itself is not done.",
    "additional": "Deeper Insight: The nursing care plan for a client with an AV fistula is often summarized as \"Protect the Lifeline.\" Key patient teaching points include:\n\n- No BP, IVs, or blood draws on the fistula arm.\n- Do not wear tight clothing, jewelry, or watches on the fistula arm.\n- Do not sleep on the fistula arm.\n- Do not carry heavy objects with the fistula arm.\n- Check for the bruit and thrill daily at home.\n\nPossible Next Question (NCK Focus): \"A nurse is assessing the AV fistula of a client and is unable to palpate a thrill. What is the nurse's priority action?\" The answer would be to notify the physician and the dialysis unit immediately, as this indicates a possible thrombosis of the fistula."

      "D": "The amount of urine will be elevated due to the amount of intravenous fluids administered during the initial phases of treatment."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This question describes the classic fluid shift phases after a major burn.\n\nEmergent (Resuscitative) Phase (First 24-48 hours): A massive inflammatory response causes a dramatic increase in capillary permeability. Fluid, protein, and electrolytes shift from the intravascular space (blood vessels) into the interstitial space, causing severe edema (\"third-spacing\"). This leads to intravascular hypovolemia (low blood volume) and decreased blood flow to the kidneys. The result is oliguria (significantly reduced urine output), even with aggressive IV fluid resuscitation.\n\nDiuretic (Remobilization) Phase (After 48 hours): Capillary membrane integrity is restored. The fluid and electrolytes shift back from the interstitial space into the intravascular space. This increases renal blood flow and leads to a significant increase in urine output (diuresis).\n\nTherefore, the urine output will be reduced for the first 24-48 hours and then increase as the client enters the diuretic phase.",
    "additional": "Key Priority: The priority during the emergent phase is massive fluid resuscitation to prevent hypovolemic shock and acute kidney injury (AKI).\n\nParkland (Baxter) Formula: A common formula for calculating fluid needs in the first 24 hours: 4 mL of Lactated Ringer's x % TBSA burn x patient weight (kg). Half of the total volume is given in the first 8 hours, and the remaining half over the next 16 hours.\n\nMonitoring Fluid Resuscitation: The single best indicator of adequate fluid resuscitation is urine output.

With decreased blood flow to the kidneys, GFR will be reduced.\n\niv. Specific gravity elevated: Due to hypovolemia and the body's attempt to conserve water, the kidneys produce a small amount of highly concentrated urine. This results in an elevated urine specific gravity (>1.030).\n\ni. Creatinine clearance reduced: This is directly related to a reduced GFR. While correct, GFR is the more fundamental measure.\n\nii. BUN reduced: This is incorrect. Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) would be elevated due to dehydration (hemoconcentration) and the massive catabolism (breakdown of protein tissue) occurring from the burn injury.\n\nSince option 'b' incorrectly includes \"BUN reduced,\" and option 'c' correctly identifies two of the most prominent signs of prerenal AKI (reduced GFR and concentrated urine), it is the best answer.",

Therefore, limiting their intake is a key intervention.\n\nOption 'b' (organ meats, sardines) lists foods high in purines, which should be limited for uric acid stones.\n\nOption 'c' (tomatoes, fruits, nuts) can be high in oxalate, which should be limited for calcium oxalate stones.\n\nOption 'd' lists foods high in animal protein, which can increase the risk of several types of stones by increasing urinary excretion of calcium and uric acid, but milk products are the most direct answer for calcium phosphate stones.",
    "additional": "General dietary advice for all stones: Increase fluid intake (to produce 2-3L of urine/day), limit sodium (high sodium intake increases calcium excretion in urine).\n\nStone Types and Diet:\n\nCalcium Oxalate (most common): Limit spinach, rhubarb, beets, nuts, tea, chocolate, wheat bran.\n\nUric Acid: Limit purines (organ meats, poultry, fish, gravies, red wine).\n\nStruvite (Infection): These are caused by UTIs.

      "C": "Knowledge, Deficient",
      "D": "Skin Integrity, Risk for Impaired"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The passage of a ureteral calculus (kidney stone in the ureter) causes distention and spasm of the ureter, resulting in renal colic. This is recognized as one of the most severe types of pain a person can experience. While the other nursing diagnoses may be relevant (e.g., deficient fluid volume due to nausea/vomiting from pain), the excruciating pain is the immediate, priority problem that must be addressed. According to Maslow's hierarchy and nursing principles, severe pain is a high-priority physiological need.",
    "additional": "Pain Management: Opioid analgesics are often required. NSAIDs (like ketorolac) are also very effective as they inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, reducing ureteral spasm.\n\nOther Interventions:\n\nStrain all urine: To retrieve the stone for analysis.\n\nForce fluids: To help flush the stone, unless contraindicated.\n\nAlpha-blockers (e.g., tamsulosin): May be prescribed to relax the ureteral muscles and facilitate stone passage.\n\nReference: Lewis's Medical-Surgical Nursing, Chapter 45: Urinary System Problems."

    "question": "The nurse assessing a client newly admitted to the medical-surgical unit with glomerulonephritis expects to find which of the following classic manifestations of this disorder?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Acute flank pain, nausea, and vomiting",
      "B": "Hematuria, proteinuria, and edema",
      "C": "Headache, fever, dehydration",
      "D": "Weight loss, anemia, and fatigue"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Acute glomerulonephritis is an inflammatory disease of the glomeruli, often following a streptococcal infection. The inflammation damages the glomerular capillary membrane, making it more permeable.\n\nHematuria: Damage allows red blood cells to leak into the urine, often described as cola-colored or rusty.\n\nProteinuria: Damage allows proteins (especially albumin) to leak into the urine.\n\nEdema: The loss of protein (albumin) from the blood reduces oncotic pressure, causing fluid to shift into the interstitial tissues. It typically presents as periorbital (around the eyes) and peripheral edema.\n\nHypertension is also a classic sign due to sodium and water retention.\n\nOption 'a' is more characteristic of pyelonephritis or renal calculi. Option 'c' is non-specific. Option 'd' is more characteristic of chronic renal failure.",
    "additional": "Cause: Most commonly post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN), occurring 1-2 weeks after a strep throat or skin infection.\n\nLabs: Elevated BUN and creatinine, decreased GFR, positive antistreptolysin O (ASO) titer.\n\nManagement: Focuses on treating the underlying cause (antibiotics for strep), managing symptoms (antihypertensives, diuretics), and dietary restrictions (low sodium, low protein).\n\nReference: Brunner & Suddarth's Textbook of Medical-Surgical Nursing, Chapter 46: Management of Patients with Kidney Disorders."

    "question": "The nursing diagnosis established for a client with acute glomerulonephritis is Fluid Volume, Excess related to plasma protein deficit and sodium and water retention. Which of the following assessments provides the most accurate indication of fluid balance for this client?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Daily weight",
      "B": "Intake and output records",
      "C": "Serum sodium levels",
      "D": "Vital signs"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Daily weight is the single most sensitive and accurate indicator of fluid volume status. A weight change of 1 kg is equivalent to a 1-liter fluid gain or loss. While the other options are important components of a fluid status assessment, they are less accurate than daily weight.\n\nIntake and output (I&O) records are useful but prone to error and do not account for insensible fluid losses (e.g., through skin and respiration).\n\nSerum sodium levels can be altered by many factors and may be normal, high, or low in fluid volume excess (e.g., dilutional hyponatremia).\n\nVital signs (specifically blood pressure and heart rate) will change, but these changes are often late signs and can be influenced by other factors.",
    "additional": "Standard for Daily Weight: Weigh the client at the same time each day (usually before breakfast, after voiding), using the same scale, with the same amount of clothing.\n\nOther signs of Fluid Volume Excess: Pitting edema, crackles in the lungs, shortness of breath, distended neck veins (JVD), hypertension, and tachycardia (bounding pulse).\n\nReference: Fundamentals of Nursing (any standard textbook, such as Potter & Perry or Taylor)."

    "question": "A client returns to the medical-surgical unit following a right nephrectomy, and is receiving oxygen via nasal cannula at a rate of 2 l/minute. The nurse assesses the following: respiratory rate 12/minute, shallow breathing with inadequate lung expansion, and client complaint of shortness of breath. Which nursing intervention has the highest priority at this time?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Continue to monitor vital signs and respiratory status.",
      "B": "Encourage the client to deep-breathe and use an incentive spirometer.",
      "C": "Increase oxygen flow rate to at least 5 l/minute.",
      "D": "Position the client with head of bed elevated 15 degrees."
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The assessment findings (shallow breathing, inadequate expansion, SOB) in a post-operative client, especially after an abdominal or flank incision like a nephrectomy, are classic signs of atelectasis (collapse of alveoli). This is caused by pain, anesthesia effects, and splinting of the incision. The highest priority is to treat the underlying cause of the poor gas exchange, which is the collapsed alveoli.\n\nEncouraging deep breathing and incentive spirometry directly addresses this problem by re-expanding the alveoli and improving ventilation.\n\nMonitoring (a) is passive and not an intervention. Increasing O2 (c) is a temporary fix that doesn't solve the ventilation problem. Elevating the HOB to 15 degrees (d) is insufficient; a higher position (Semi-Fowler's or High-Fowler's) would be better, but the primary intervention is to promote lung expansion.",
    "additional": "Post-op Respiratory Complications: Atelectasis is the most common, and if untreated, can lead to pneumonia.\n\nNursing Care to Prevent Atelectasis: Early ambulation, effective pain management (so the patient is willing to breathe deeply), frequent repositioning, and consistent use of incentive spirometry (e.g., 10 times per hour while awake).\n\nNephrectomy-specific concerns: Risk for hemorrhage (monitor urine output, VS, dressing), paralytic ileus, and infection.\n\nReference: Lewis's Medical-Surgical Nursing, Chapter 19: Surgery."

    "question": "Which of the following laboratory data does the nurse anticipate for the client with chronic renal failure prior to hemodialysis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Increased urine osmolality",
      "B": "Decreased phosphorus",
      "C": "Decreased potassium",
      "D": "Increased creatinine"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Chronic renal failure (CRF), also known as end-stage renal disease (ESRD), is characterized by the kidneys' inability to perform their essential functions.\n\nd. Increased creatinine: Creatinine is a waste product of muscle metabolism that is normally excreted by the kidneys. In CRF, the kidneys cannot clear it, so serum levels rise significantly. It is a hallmark indicator of renal failure.\n\na. Increased urine osmolality: In late-stage CRF, the kidneys lose their ability to concentrate urine. Urine osmolality would become fixed at a level similar to plasma (isosthenuria), which is a decrease from normal concentrated urine.\n\nb. Decreased phosphorus: The kidneys excrete phosphorus. In CRF, excretion is impaired, leading to hyperphosphatemia (increased phosphorus).\n\nc. Decreased potassium: The kidneys excrete potassium. In CRF, excretion is impaired, leading to hyperkalemia (increased potassium), which is life-threatening.",
    "additional": "Other expected lab findings in CRF:\n\nElevated BUN\n\nMetabolic Acidosis (kidneys can't excrete H+ ions or regenerate bicarbonate)\n\nHypocalcemia (due to high phosphorus and lack of activated Vitamin D)\n\nAnemia (due to decreased production of erythropoietin)\n\nPurpose of Hemodialysis: To filter waste products (like creatinine, urea), remove excess fluid, and correct electrolyte and acid-base imbalances.\n\nReference: Brunner & Suddarth's Textbook of Medical-Surgical Nursing, Chapter 47: Management of Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease."

    "question": "The nurse administering calcium acetate two tablets p.o. with each meal to the client with chronic renal failure understands the rationale for this treatment as which of the following?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Decreases serum creatinine.",
      "B": "Lowers serum phosphate.",
      "C": "Neutralizes gastric acid.",
      "D": "Stimulates appetite."
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Patients with chronic renal failure develop hyperphosphatemia because the kidneys cannot excrete dietary phosphate. Calcium acetate (PhosLo) is a phosphate binder. When taken with meals, the calcium in the medication binds to the phosphate from the food in the GI tract. This forms an insoluble compound (calcium phosphate) that is then excreted in the feces, preventing the phosphate from being absorbed into the bloodstream. This action effectively lowers serum phosphate levels. It does not affect creatinine, act as an antacid in this context, or stimulate appetite.",
    "additional": "Relationship between Calcium and Phosphorus: They have an inverse relationship. When phosphate levels are high, calcium levels tend to be low.\n\nOther Phosphate Binders: Sevelamer hydrochloride (Renagel) and lanthanum carbonate (Fosrenol) are non-calcium-based phosphate binders, often used to avoid causing hypercalcemia.\n\nImportance of taking with meals: Binders must be present in the GI tract at the same time as the food to be effective.\n\nComplications of Hyperphosphatemia: Leads to renal osteodystrophy (bone disease) and metastatic calcification (calcium-phosphate deposits in soft tissues like blood vessels and the heart).\n\nReference: Davis's Drug Guide for Nurses (for Calcium Acetate)."

    "question": "The nurse notes the presence of a cloudy dialysate return for a client in acute renal failure receiving peritoneal dialysis. Which of the following actions does the nurse initiate after notifying the physician?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Culture the dialysate return.",
      "B": "Chart the cloudy dialysate.",
      "C": "Measure abdominal girth.",
      "D": "Slow dialysate instillation."
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Cloudy or opaque dialysate effluent (return) is the earliest and most reliable sign of peritonitis, the most common and serious complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD). The cloudiness is caused by white blood cells and fibrin in the fluid. After notifying the physician of this critical finding, the immediate next step is to obtain a sample of the effluent for culture and sensitivity testing. This will identify the causative organism and guide the appropriate antibiotic therapy. While charting (b) is necessary, it is not the priority action. Measuring girth (c) assesses for fluid retention, and slowing the instillation (d) addresses inflow problems; neither addresses the urgent sign of infection.",
    "additional": "Other signs of Peritonitis: Abdominal pain/tenderness, fever, nausea/vomiting.\n\nPrevention: Meticulous sterile technique during all PD exchanges is crucial to prevent peritonitis.\n\nTreatment: Antibiotics are typically added directly to the dialysate bags.\n\nPD Catheter Exit Site Infection: Another common complication. Assess the exit site for redness, tenderness, and drainage at every exchange.\n\nReference: Lewis's Medical-Surgical Nursing, Chapter 46: Renal and Urologic Problems."

  {
    "question": "The nurse plans to reinforce dietary teaching for the client in renal failure, emphasizing that protein foods selected should be those that are complete proteins, having high biological value. Which of the following foods will the nurse explain meet this criterion?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Eggs",
      "B": "Legumes",
      "C": "Nuts",
      "D": "Vegetables"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "While patients with renal failure are often on a protein-restricted diet to decrease nitrogenous waste, the protein they do consume should be of high biological value (HBV). HBV proteins are \"complete\" proteins, meaning they contain all the essential amino acids the body cannot synthesize on its own. This allows for optimal use by the body for tissue maintenance and repair, producing less urea waste.\n\nHBV protein sources include: Eggs, dairy products, meat, fish, and poultry.\n\nLow biological value (LBV) or \"incomplete\" protein sources lack one or more essential amino acids. These include legumes (beans), nuts, grains, and vegetables.\n\nTherefore, eggs are the correct example of an HBV protein source among the choices.",
    "additional": "Renal Diet Summary: Typically involves restrictions on protein, sodium, potassium, and phosphorus. Fluid intake is also often restricted.\n\nHigh Potassium Foods to Avoid: Bananas, oranges, potatoes, tomatoes, avocados, salt substitutes.\n\nHigh Phosphorus Foods to Avoid: Dairy, dried beans, peas, nuts, cola, chocolate.\n\nReference: Lewis's Medical-Surgical Nursing, Chapter 46: Renal and Urologic Problems."

      "C": "Tenderness on the area over the transplanted kidney, weight gain, Hypokalemia.",
      "D": "Hyperuricemia, hyperactivity and polyuria"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Kidney rejection occurs when the recipient's immune system recognizes the transplanted kidney as foreign and attacks it. This attack causes inflammation and damages the kidney's ability to function.\n\nOliguria: A hallmark sign of a failing kidney is a significant decrease in urine output (less than 400 mL/24h).\n\nFluid Retention: Leads to weight gain and edema due to poor excretion.\n\nHypertension: Result of increased volume and possibly elevated renin levels from the damaged kidney.",
    "additional": "Analyzing Other Options:\n\n(a) Anemia is more common in chronic kidney failure; hypotension is not typical unless there's shock.\n\n(c) Tenderness and weight gain are consistent, but hypokalemia is incorrect—acute rejection usually causes hyperkalemia.\n\n(d) Polyuria and hyperactivity are not signs of rejection.\n\nTypes of Rejection:\n- Hyperacute: Immediate; organ must be removed.\n- Acute: Days to months; reversible with immunosuppressants.\n- Chronic: Years later; slow fibrosis.\n\nOther signs:\n- Fever\n- Malaise\n- Pain at graft site (iliac fossa)\n- ↑ Creatinine and BUN\n\nTextbook Reference: Brunner & Suddarth's Textbook of Medical-Surgical Nursing, Chapter 54."

      "C": "Turn to the side.",
      "D": "Hold the labia or shaft of penis"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "During catheter insertion, asking the patient to 'bear down' relaxes the external urinary sphincter, facilitating easier catheter passage. It mimics the act of voiding, which helps the pelvic floor muscles relax.",
    "additional": "Other Options:\n\n(b) Deep breathing helps general relaxation but doesn't directly relax the urinary sphincter.\n\n(c) Turning to the side is unrelated to the insertion technique.\n\n(d) The nurse should handle positioning and maintain sterility—not the patient.\n\nKey Catheter Insertion Practices:\n- Use sterile technique.\n- Proper positioning: Female — dorsal recumbent; Male — supine.\n- Lubricate catheter (esp. in males).\n- Insert until urine flows, then advance 1–2 inches further.\n\nCAUTI Prevention:\n- Use catheters only when necessary.\n- Keep drainage bag below bladder level.\n- Maintain closed system.\n- Daily perineal hygiene.\n- Prompt removal when no longer needed.\n\nTextbook Reference: Potter & Perry’s Fundamentals of Nursing, Chapter 46."

      "D": "Tumours, Trauma and chemical toxicity"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Pre-renal acute kidney injury (AKI) results from factors that reduce blood flow to the kidneys without directly damaging them. Hemorrhage, burns, and dehydration are classic causes of hypovolemia, leading to decreased renal perfusion.",
    "additional": "Types of AKI:\n- Pre-renal: Caused by poor perfusion (e.g., hemorrhage, burns, dehydration).\n- Intra-renal: Direct damage (e.g., nephrotoxins, glomerulonephritis).\n- Post-renal: Obstruction (e.g., BPH, stones, clots).\n\nLab Tip: BUN:Creatinine ratio > 20:1 suggests pre-renal cause.\n\nReversible: Pre-renal AKI is often reversible with prompt fluid replacement.\n\nTextbook Reference: Lewis’s Medical-Surgical Nursing, Chapter 46."

    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Albumin maintains oncotic (pulling) pressure in blood vessels. In nephrotic syndrome, albumin is lost in urine (proteinuria), causing hypoalbuminemia. This reduces oncotic pressure and allows fluid to leak into tissues, resulting in edema.",
    "additional": "Key Edema Mechanism:\n- ↓ Albumin → ↓ Oncotic pressure → Fluid shifts into interstitial space\n\nOther Facts:\n- Liver compensates by producing more lipids → hyperlipidemia\n- Despite swelling, patients may be intravascularly dehydrated\n- Diuretics must be used cautiously\n\nCompare Edema Causes:\n- Heart Failure: ↑ Hydrostatic pressure\n- Liver Failure: ↓ Albumin + ↑ Portal pressure\n- Nephrotic Syndrome: ↓ Oncotic pressure only\n\nTextbook Reference: Lewis’s Medical-Surgical Nursing, Chapter 45."
