In infants, it's often on the cheeks and extensor surfaces. Associated Conditions (The 'Atopic Triad'): Personal or family history of asthma and allergic rhinitis. Appearance: Ill-defined, erythematous patches with scaling, and in acute phases, may be vesicular (tiny blisters) and weepy. Chronic scratching leads to lichenification (thickened, leathery skin).",
    "additional": "Distinguish it vs. Contact Dermatitis: Atopic is chronic with a classic distribution. Contact dermatitis is acute, linked to a specific exposure, and the rash pattern will match the contact area (e.g., linear for poison ivy, a square under a patch). Vs.

Tinea Corporis (Ringworm): The herald patch can look like ringworm. However, a KOH prep for ringworm would be positive for fungi, and the subsequent \"Christmas tree\" rash confirms pityriasis. Secondary syphilis can also mimic this, so it's a key differential. NCK-Style Question: A 22-year-old female presents with a widespread rash.
