    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Why (C) is Correct: The entire description is the textbook definition of servant leadership. This leadership philosophy, first proposed by Robert K. Greenleaf, turns the traditional power pyramid upside down. The leader's primary motivation is a deep-seated desire to serve others—their staff, customers, and community. Key characteristics described in the question are:\n\nPassion for serving: The core of servant leadership.\n\nTakes time to listen: Emphasizes deep, empathetic listening.\n\nPrefers to be a teacher first: Focuses on the growth and development of their people.\n\nThe goal is to help their team members develop and perform as highly as possible.\n\nWhy (A), (B), and (D) are Incorrect:\n\n(A) Transformational leader: While they also focus on developing followers, their primary drive is to inspire and motivate the team towards a shared vision and organizational change. The focus is more on the mission.\n\n(B) Transactional leader: This leader focuses on tasks, rewards, and punishments. It's a \"give and take\" relationship based on clear transactions (e.g., \"you do this work, and I will give you this reward\").\n\n(D) Charismatic leader: This leader inspires followers through the power of their personality, charm, and communication skills. While a servant leader can be charismatic, their motivation is service, not just influence through personality.",

Followers are drawn to the leader's personality and feel a sense of emotional connection and reverence. This option perfectly captures that dynamic of attraction and inspiration.\n\nWhy (B), (C), and (D) are Incorrect:\n\n(B) Acts... to yield positive results: This describes a results-oriented or task-focused leader, which is more characteristic of a transactional style.\n\n(C) Uses visioning as the core...: While charismatic leaders often have a compelling vision, this is the defining characteristic of a transformational leader. Transformational leadership is a broader concept that includes charisma but also intellectual stimulation and individualized consideration.\n\n(D) Matches his leadership style to the situation...: This describes situational or contingency leadership, where the leader adapts their style based on the followers' maturity and the task at hand.",
    "additional": "Future Test Focus & Additional Concepts:\n\nTransformational vs. Charismatic Leadership: These are often confused.\n\nCharisma is a personal trait. A leader can be charismatic but use it for selfish or unethical ends.\n\nTransformational Leadership is a process that elevates both the leader and the followers. It has four components (the \"Four I's\"):\n\nIdealized Influence: Being a role model (this is the charismatic part).\nInspirational Motivation: Communicating a compelling vision.\nIntellectual Stimulation: Challenging assumptions and encouraging creativity.\nIndividualized Consideration: Acting as a coach and mentor to followers.\n\nAll transformational leaders are charismatic, but not all charismatic leaders are transformational."

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Why (C) is Correct: The Great Man Theory is one of the earliest leadership theories. It asserts that leaders are born with certain heroic, mythic, and innate qualities that make them natural leaders. It suggests that leadership is an inherited quality and that great leaders arise when they are needed. The phrase \"leaders are born and not made\" is the classic summary of this theory.\n\nWhy (A) is the Next Best but (C) is More Precise:\n\n(A) Trait Theory: This theory evolved from the Great Man Theory. It also focuses on identifying the specific personality traits (e.g., intelligence, self-confidence, integrity) that are common to leaders. It is very similar, but the \"Great Man\" theory is the original historical concept that specifically emphasized the \"born leader\" idea.\n\nWhy (B) and (D) are Incorrect:\n\n(B) Charismatic Theory: Focuses on personal charm and inspiration, not necessarily that these qualities are inherited at birth.\n\n(D) Situational Theory: This is the opposite of the Great Man theory. It argues that leadership style is dependent on the situation and is not a fixed quality of the individual.",

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Why (C) is Correct: This question describes a classic situational leadership scenario.\n\nLaissez-faire (French for \"let them do\") is a hands-off leadership style where the leader provides minimal direction and gives the followers maximum freedom to make their own decisions.\n\nThis style is most effective and appropriate when the followers are highly skilled, experienced, self-motivated, and trustworthy, as described in the question (\"self-directed, experts and are matured\"). An authoritarian or overly-involved style would be de-motivating and inefficient for such a team.\n\nWhy (A), (B), and (D) are Incorrect:\n\n(A) Democratic: This style involves group participation and decision-making. It would be useful, but for a team of true experts, even this level of group process might be less efficient than a laissez-faire approach.\n\n(B) Authoritarian: This style involves the leader making all decisions with little to no input from the group. It is completely inappropriate for a team of mature experts and would lead to resentment and poor performance.\n\n(D) Bureaucratic: This leader follows rules and procedures to the letter.

(Worst)\n\nTransactional Leadership (The \"Transactions\"):\n- Management-by-Exception (Passive): The leader only intervenes when problems become serious. They wait for mistakes to happen. (Ineffective)\n- Management-by-Exception (Active): The leader actively monitors for mistakes and deviations from rules and takes corrective action. They are looking for errors.

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Why (A) is Correct: This question refers to Likert's System of Management. The Benevolent-Authoritative (System 2) style is like a master-servant relationship. The manager is paternalistic and acts in a \"benevolent\" or kind way, but they fundamentally do not trust their subordinates with important decisions. They believe they know what's best for the employees. This leads to a condescending form of trust—they trust them to carry out orders, but not to think for themselves.\n\nWhy (B), (C), and (D) are Incorrect or Less Precise:\n\n(B) Gives economic or ego awards: This is a feature of the style, but (A) describes the underlying attitude that drives the behavior, making it a more fundamental characteristic.\n\n(C) Communicates downward: This is also a feature, but it's a characteristic of both Exploitative-Authoritative (System 1) and Benevolent-Authoritative (System 2). Option (A) specifically defines the tone of the Benevolent style.\n\n(D) Allows decision making among subordinates: This is explicitly what a Benevolent-Authoritative manager does not do for any significant decisions. This behavior is characteristic of the Consultative (System 3) and Participative (System 4) styles.",
    "additional": "Future Test Focus & Additional Concepts:\n\nLikert's Four Systems of Management:\n\nSystem 1: Exploitative-Authoritative: The manager uses fear and threats. Communication is downward only. There is no trust. Decisions are made at the top. (Pure autocrat).\n\nSystem 2: Benevolent-Authoritative: The manager uses rewards and a paternalistic attitude. Communication is mostly downward. There is condescending, master-servant trust. Some minor decisions may be allowed at lower levels, but all important ones are made at the top.\n\nSystem 3: Consultative: The manager uses rewards and occasional involvement in decisions. Communication flows both up and down. There is substantial, but not complete, trust. The manager consults with subordinates before making decisions but retains the final say.\n\nSystem 4: Participative-Group: The manager fosters a team environment. Communication flows up, down, and sideways. There is complete trust and confidence. Decision-making is spread throughout the organization, often through group processes.\n\nMcGregor's Theory X and Theory Y:\nTheory X Manager: Assumes employees are inherently lazy, dislike work, and need to be controlled and directed. This manager would use an Authoritative style (Likert System 1 or 2).\nTheory Y Manager: Assumes employees are self-motivated, enjoy work, and will seek responsibility if given the opportunity.

    "additional": "Future Test Focus & Additional Concepts:\n\nThe Five Rights of Delegation (In Detail):\n\nRight Task: Is this task appropriate to delegate? It should be routine, have a predictable outcome, require minimal problem-solving, and not involve nursing judgment or assessment. You cannot delegate tasks that are part of the nursing process (Assessment, Diagnosis, Planning, Evaluation) or require clinical judgment.\n\nRight Circumstance: Is the patient setting appropriate? Is the patient stable? Are the necessary resources and supervision available?\n\nRight Person: Is this delegate (e.g., a Nursing Assistant, LPN/LVN) competent to perform the task? Does it fall within their scope of practice and job description?\n\nRight Direction/Communication: Did you provide a clear, concise, and complete explanation of the task? This includes the objective, timeline, what to report, and any patient-specific instructions.\n\nRight Supervision/Evaluation: Did you appropriately monitor the delegate, evaluate the outcome of the task, and provide constructive feedback? The delegating nurse retains ultimate accountability for the task.\n\nDelegation Scenarios: The most common exam questions are scenarios. \"Which of the following tasks can the RN delegate to the Unlicensed Assistive Personnel (UAP)?\"\n\nCan Delegate to UAP: Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) like bathing, feeding (a stable patient), positioning, ambulation, taking vital signs (on a stable patient), recording intake and output.\n\nCannot Delegate to UAP: Medication administration, inserting IVs, patient teaching, performing assessments, interpreting data, developing a care plan."

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This question asks for the most significant red flag for drug diversion (theft of medication for personal use).\n\nd. The nurse in question frequently wastes medications. This is a major indicator. A nurse may document that a partial dose of a controlled substance was \"wasted\" (e.g., if a 2mg dose is ordered and the vial contains 4mg), but instead of properly disposing of the remainder, they divert it for themselves. Frequent or excessive wasting, especially without a witness signature as required by policy, is highly suspicious.\n\nOther common signs include volunteering to give pain medications for other nurses' patients, patients complaining of unrelieved pain despite receiving medication, frequent trips to the bathroom or supply closet after handling narcotics, and changes in mood or performance.\n\nDistractor Rationale: The other options are less specific. A nurse requesting a large assignment (a) or declining breaks (c) could be a dedicated employee. Preferring not to be the med nurse (b) is the opposite of a behavior typical of diversion.",

The leader encourages discussion and feedback. This style builds morale, fosters teamwork, and often leads to better, more creative decisions because it incorporates multiple perspectives. Its main drawback is that it is time-consuming. Therefore, it is the BEST style to use when there is time.\n\nAutocratic (or Authoritarian): The leader makes decisions independently with little or no input from others. This style is fast and efficient, making it the best choice in an emergency or crisis when a decision is needed immediately (e.g., during a cardiac arrest).\n\nLaissez-faire: The leader provides little or no direction and gives the group complete freedom. This style is effective only with a team that is highly mature, experienced, and self-motivated.\n\nSituational: This is a leadership theory, not a single style. It proposes that the most effective leaders adapt their style (e.g., from autocratic to democratic) based on the situation and the maturity level of their followers.

    },
    "answer": "a",
    "explanation": "This question tests knowledge of the classic functions of management, often remembered by the mnemonic POSDC.\n\nThe 5 Functions of Management:\n\nPlanning: Setting goals, objectives, and determining a course of action to achieve them. This relates to option (b).\n\nOrganizing: Establishing the structure to carry out the plan. This involves assigning tasks, grouping activities, and allocating resources. This relates to option (d).\n\nStaffing: Acquiring, deploying, and retaining qualified personnel. This includes recruiting, interviewing, hiring, and orienting. This relates to option (c).\n\nDirecting (or Leading): Influencing and motivating staff to achieve organizational goals. Includes communication, delegation, and conflict management.\n\nControlling: The process of monitoring performance, comparing it with established standards, and taking corrective action as needed to ensure goals are met.\n\nActivities of the Controlling Function: Performance appraisals, financial audits, quality control checks, and budget reviews are all key activities of the controlling function. Therefore, option (a) is the correct answer.",
    "additional": "Quality Management (QM): A key part of the controlling function in healthcare. It involves continuous monitoring and evaluation of care processes and outcomes to identify areas for improvement.\n\nQM Models:\n\nTotal Quality Management (TQM): A philosophy that involves everyone in the organization in a continual effort to improve quality and customer satisfaction.\n\nContinuous Quality Improvement (CQI): An ongoing process of identifying, analyzing, and improving processes.\n\nSix Sigma: A data-driven approach that aims to eliminate defects and reduce variation in processes.\n\nThe Control Process: Involves three steps: 1) Establishing standards, 2) Measuring performance against standards, and 3) Taking corrective action.\n\nTextbook Reference: Marquis, B.

      "d": "Screening of the working environment to check that recommended preventive measures are put in place."
    },
    "answer": "d",
    "explanation": "This question requires applying the levels of prevention to an occupational health setting.\n\nPrimary Prevention: Aims to prevent the disease or injury from ever occurring. It focuses on health promotion and risk reduction.\n\nSecondary Prevention: Aims to detect and treat a disease or injury at its earliest stage. It involves screening and early diagnosis.\n\nTertiary Prevention: Aims to reduce the impact of an established disease or injury and prevent complications or disability. It involves treatment and rehabilitation.\n\nAnalyzing the Options in an Occupational Context:\n\n(a) First aid is tertiary prevention; it treats an injury that has already occurred to minimize complications.\n\n(b) This is related to managing an exposure that has already happened, and it inappropriately blames the employee.\n\n(c) Pre-employment screening is a form of secondary prevention (screening for existing conditions).\n\n(d) This is the definition of primary prevention. It involves assessing the workplace itself to identify and eliminate or control hazards before they can cause harm to an employee. Examples include ensuring proper machine guards are in place, providing adequate ventilation, and enforcing the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).",
    "additional": "Hierarchy of Controls: A framework used in occupational health to prioritize ways to control hazards, from most effective to least effective.\n\nElimination: Physically remove the hazard.\n\nSubstitution: Replace the hazard with a safer alternative.\n\nEngineering Controls: Isolate people from the hazard (e.g., ventilation systems, machine guards).\n\nAdministrative Controls: Change the way people work (e.g., job rotation, safety policies).\n\nPersonal Protective Equipment (PPE): Protect the worker with barriers (e.g., gloves, respirators). This is the last line of defense.\n\nTextbook Reference: Stanhope, M., & Lancaster, J. (2016). Public Health Nursing: Population-Centered Health Care in the Community.

    },
    "answer": "a",
    "explanation": "Community health nursing (CHN) has a distinct philosophy and set of principles that differentiate it from acute care nursing.\n\nCore Principles of CHN:\n\nThe community is the client. The focus is on the health of the entire population, not just individuals.\n\nThe primary obligation is to achieve the greatest good for the greatest number of people.\n\nCHN focuses on primary prevention as a priority.\n\nIt involves a collaborative process with the client (the community) as an equal partner.\n\nAnalyzing the Options:\n\n(a) A key principle is a balanced approach that includes not only treating existing illness (curative) but also actively promoting health and preventing disease (preventive and promotive). This comprehensive view is central to CHN.\n\n(b) Vertical programs (which focus on a single disease, like a malaria program) are often criticized for creating silos. CHN promotes integrated, horizontal approaches, so minimizing them could be seen as a positive principle, but (a) is more fundamental.\n\n(c) CHN promotes decentralization of services to make them more accessible to the community, not centralization.\n\n(d) CHN strongly advocates for the use of a wide range of providers, including community health workers, traditional healers (where appropriate), and other lay personnel, not only health professionals.",

      "d": "Strong verbal warning, interdiction without pay, discharge with opportunity to appeal, formal written warning"
    },
    "answer": "b",
    "explanation": "Progressive discipline is a formal process that managers use to address employee performance or conduct issues. It follows a series of steps that increase in severity.\n\nThe Standard Sequence:\n\nInformal Counseling/Discussion: The manager first discusses the issue with the employee to make them aware of the problem and expectations.\n\nVerbal Warning: If the behavior continues, a formal verbal warning is given. This is usually documented in the manager's notes.\n\nWritten Warning: If the problem persists, a formal written warning is issued and placed in the employee's personnel file.\n\nSuspension: The employee may be suspended from work, usually without pay, for a period of time.\n\nTermination: If there is still no improvement, employment is terminated.\n\nAnalyzing the Options:\n\n(a, c, d) These have the steps in an illogical order. Suspension and interdiction are very serious steps that come much later in the process.\n\n(b) This option most closely follows the correct progressive sequence. It starts with investigation and discussion, then moves to a verbal warning, and then escalates to a formal written warning.",
    "additional": "Due Process: The employee has the right to be informed of the problem, to be heard, and to have their case considered fairly.\n\nDocumentation: It is critical for the manager to document every step of the disciplinary process clearly, objectively, and factually. This is essential for legal protection and to demonstrate that a fair process was followed.\n\nTextbook Reference: Marquis, B. L., & Huston, C. J. (2017).

    "answer": "b",
    "explanation": "The disciplinary process should be progressive, meaning it starts with the least severe action and escalates only if the undesirable behavior continues. It must also be fair and based on evidence.\n\nOption (b) outlines a logical and legally defensible progressive sequence:\n\nInvestigation: The manager must first gather facts to confirm a rule was broken.\n\nDiscussion and Brief Warning (Informal): The first step is often an informal private discussion to make the employee aware of the issue and the rules. This is sometimes called counseling.\n\nStrong Verbal Warning (Formal): If the behavior continues, a formal verbal warning is given and documented in the employee's file.\n\nFormal Written Warning: The next step is a written warning that clearly states the problem, evidence, and consequences of future infractions. The employee is usually asked to sign it.\n\nOption (a) is out of order (suspension is a later step).\nOption (c) starts with suspension, which is a severe step and would not be first.\nOption (d) is also out of order and includes very severe actions like interdiction and discharge early in the sequence.",
    "additional": "Progressive Discipline Steps (General Order):\n- Informal Counseling / Verbal Admonishment.\n- Formal Verbal Warning.\n- Formal Written Warning.\n- Suspension (with or without pay).\n- Termination (Discharge).\n\nKey Principles of Discipline:\n- \"Hot Stove\" Rule: Discipline should be immediate, consistent, impartial, and come with a warning. Like touching a hot stove, the consequence is swift and predictable for anyone who does it.\n- Documentation: Meticulous documentation is crucial at every step to protect the employee, the manager, and the organization from legal challenges. Document objective facts, dates, times, specific behaviors, and actions taken.\n- Focus on the Behavior, Not the Person: Discipline should address the specific unacceptable action, not the employee's personality."

    },
    "answer": "a",
    "explanation": "This question asks you to define Functional Nursing, which is a model of care delivery.\n\nOption (a) is the correct definition. In functional nursing, care is broken down into tasks, and each nurse is assigned specific tasks for all patients on the unit. For example, one nurse might do all the medication administration, another might do all the wound dressings, and a nursing assistant might do all the vital signs and baths. It is a task-oriented model.\n\nOption (b) describes Total Patient Care (or Case Method), where one nurse is responsible for all aspects of care for a few patients during their shift.\n\nOption (c) describes Team Nursing, where a team leader (usually an RN) is responsible for a group of patients, but delegates tasks to team members (other RNs, LPNs, assistants) who then provide care to those patients.\n\nOption (d) is the ideal goal of nursing but best describes the outcome of Primary Nursing, where one nurse (the primary nurse) has 24-hour accountability for planning the care of a patient from admission to discharge, even when they are off-duty.",
    "additional": "Nursing Care Delivery Models:\n| Model | Description | Advantages | Disadvantages |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Functional Nursing | Task-oriented. Each staff member has a specific task. | Very efficient, useful in staff shortages. | Fragmented care, low patient satisfaction, poor communication. |\n| Team Nursing | A team led by an RN cares for a group of patients. | Fosters team collaboration, uses diverse skills. | Requires good team leader, communication can be a challenge. |\n| Total Patient Care | One nurse provides all care for a patient for one shift. | Holistic, continuous care; high patient satisfaction. | Can be costly, requires higher-skilled staff. |\n| Primary Nursing | One RN has 24/7 accountability for a patient's plan of care from admission to discharge. | High nurse & patient satisfaction, professional, coordinated care. | Expensive, requires all-RN staff. |"

      "c": "McGregor",
      "d": "Frederick Taylor"
    },
    "answer": "d",
    "explanation": "This question relates to classical management theories.\n\nOption (d) is correct. Frederick Taylor is known as the \"Father of Scientific Management.\" A core principle of his theory was that workers are primarily motivated by money. He advocated for analyzing tasks to find the \"one best way\" to perform them and then offering financial incentives (higher wages) to workers who met or exceeded production targets. This is known as a \"piece-rate\" system.\n\nOption (a), Henry Fayol, developed the \"Five Functions of Management\" (Planning, Organizing, etc.) and the \"14 Principles of Management.\" His focus was on the structure of the organization as a whole.\n\nOption (b), Max Weber, focused on bureaucracy as the ideal organizational structure, emphasizing rules, regulations, and a clear hierarchy.\n\nOption (c), Douglas McGregor, developed Theory X and Theory Y, which are human relations theories about manager's assumptions about employees. Theory X assumes employees are lazy and need to be controlled (similar to Taylor's view), while Theory Y assumes employees are self-motivated and thrive on responsibility.",
    "additional": "Classical Management Theories (Early 1900s): Focused on efficiency and productivity. Assumed workers were motivated mainly by economic needs.\n- Taylor (Scientific Management): Focus on the task.\n- Fayol (Management Functions): Focus on the manager.\n- Weber (Bureaucracy): Focus on organizational structure.\n\nHuman Relations Theories (1930s–1970s): Shifted focus to the worker's social and psychological needs.\n- Elton Mayo (Hawthorne Studies): Discovered that social factors and being observed (the Hawthorne effect) could be bigger motivators than economic incentives.\n- Maslow (Hierarchy of Needs): People are motivated to fulfill a hierarchy of needs.\n- McGregor (Theory X/Y): Manager's beliefs shape their leadership style."

    "answer": "a",
    "explanation": "This question is very similar to question 164 but uses slightly different terminology.\n\nOption (a) is the best answer. Case nursing (also known as the Case Method or Total Patient Care) is the oldest model of care delivery. In this model, one nurse is assigned responsibility for the complete care of one or more patients for a single shift.\n\nOption (b), Primary nursing, involves 24-hour accountability from admission to discharge, which is a higher level of responsibility than just for a single shift.\n\nOption (c), Team nursing, involves a group of staff members led by an RN.\n\nOption (d), Functional nursing, is task-based.",
    "additional": "It is crucial to understand the subtle but important difference between Total Patient Care (Case Method) and Primary Nursing.\n\n- Total Patient Care: Responsibility is confined to the shift. When the nurse goes home, her responsibility ends and is passed to the next nurse.\n\n- Primary Nursing: Responsibility transcends shifts. The primary nurse creates the plan of care, and associate nurses implement that plan when the primary nurse is not on duty. The primary nurse remains accountable for outcomes throughout the patient's stay."
