    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Why (C) is Correct: The entire description is the textbook definition of servant leadership. This leadership philosophy, first proposed by Robert K. Greenleaf, turns the traditional power pyramid upside down. The leader's primary motivation is a deep-seated desire to serve others—their staff, customers, and community. Key characteristics described in the question are:\n\nPassion for serving: The core of servant leadership.\n\nTakes time to listen: Emphasizes deep, empathetic listening.\n\nPrefers to be a teacher first: Focuses on the growth and development of their people.\n\nThe goal is to help their team members develop and perform as highly as possible.\n\nWhy (A), (B), and (D) are Incorrect:\n\n(A) Transformational leader: While they also focus on developing followers, their primary drive is to inspire and motivate the team towards a shared vision and organizational change. The focus is more on the mission.\n\n(B) Transactional leader: This leader focuses on tasks, rewards, and punishments. It's a \"give and take\" relationship based on clear transactions (e.g., \"you do this work, and I will give you this reward\").\n\n(D) Charismatic leader: This leader inspires followers through the power of their personality, charm, and communication skills. While a servant leader can be charismatic, their motivation is service, not just influence through personality.",

    "explanation": "Why (A) is Correct: Charismatic leadership is defined by the leader's personal charm, magnetism, and ability to inspire devotion in others. Followers are drawn to the leader's personality and feel a sense of emotional connection and reverence. This option perfectly captures that dynamic of attraction and inspiration.\n\nWhy (B), (C), and (D) are Incorrect:\n\n(B) Acts... to yield positive results: This describes a results-oriented or task-focused leader, which is more characteristic of a transactional style.\n\n(C) Uses visioning as the core...: While charismatic leaders often have a compelling vision, this is the defining characteristic of a transformational leader. Transformational leadership is a broader concept that includes charisma but also intellectual stimulation and individualized consideration.\n\n(D) Matches his leadership style to the situation...: This describes situational or contingency leadership, where the leader adapts their style based on the followers' maturity and the task at hand.",
    "additional": "Future Test Focus & Additional Concepts:\n\nTransformational vs. Charismatic Leadership: These are often confused.\n\nCharisma is a personal trait. A leader can be charismatic but use it for selfish or unethical ends.\n\nTransformational Leadership is a process that elevates both the leader and the followers. It has four components (the \"Four I's\"):\n\nIdealized Influence: Being a role model (this is the charismatic part).\nInspirational Motivation: Communicating a compelling vision.\nIntellectual Stimulation: Challenging assumptions and encouraging creativity.\nIndividualized Consideration: Acting as a coach and mentor to followers.\n\nAll transformational leaders are charismatic, but not all charismatic leaders are transformational."

      "C": "great man",
      "D": "situational"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Why (C) is Correct: The Great Man Theory is one of the earliest leadership theories. It asserts that leaders are born with certain heroic, mythic, and innate qualities that make them natural leaders. It suggests that leadership is an inherited quality and that great leaders arise when they are needed. The phrase \"leaders are born and not made\" is the classic summary of this theory.\n\nWhy (A) is the Next Best but (C) is More Precise:\n\n(A) Trait Theory: This theory evolved from the Great Man Theory. It also focuses on identifying the specific personality traits (e.g., intelligence, self-confidence, integrity) that are common to leaders. It is very similar, but the \"Great Man\" theory is the original historical concept that specifically emphasized the \"born leader\" idea.\n\nWhy (B) and (D) are Incorrect:\n\n(B) Charismatic Theory: Focuses on personal charm and inspiration, not necessarily that these qualities are inherited at birth.\n\n(D) Situational Theory: This is the opposite of the Great Man theory. It argues that leadership style is dependent on the situation and is not a fixed quality of the individual.",

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Why (C) is Correct: This question describes a classic situational leadership scenario.\n\nLaissez-faire (French for \"let them do\") is a hands-off leadership style where the leader provides minimal direction and gives the followers maximum freedom to make their own decisions.\n\nThis style is most effective and appropriate when the followers are highly skilled, experienced, self-motivated, and trustworthy, as described in the question (\"self-directed, experts and are matured\"). An authoritarian or overly-involved style would be de-motivating and inefficient for such a team.\n\nWhy (A), (B), and (D) are Incorrect:\n\n(A) Democratic: This style involves group participation and decision-making. It would be useful, but for a team of true experts, even this level of group process might be less efficient than a laissez-faire approach.\n\n(B) Authoritarian: This style involves the leader making all decisions with little to no input from the group. It is completely inappropriate for a team of mature experts and would lead to resentment and poor performance.\n\n(D) Bureaucratic: This leader follows rules and procedures to the letter. This style stifles creativity and is not suitable for a dynamic team of experts.",

They manage the existing systems and processes effectively, acting as a \"caretaker\" of the organization's current state rather than trying to change it.\n\n(C) Uses trade-offs to meet goals: This is the core of the \"transaction.\" The leader sets clear expectations and offers rewards (e.g., praise, a raise, a day off) in exchange for the follower meeting those expectations.

(Worst)\n\nTransactional Leadership (The \"Transactions\"):\n- Management-by-Exception (Passive): The leader only intervenes when problems become serious. They wait for mistakes to happen. (Ineffective)\n- Management-by-Exception (Active): The leader actively monitors for mistakes and deviations from rules and takes corrective action. They are looking for errors. (Slightly better, but still negative)\n- Contingent Reward: The leader clarifies expectations and provides rewards for meeting them. This is the \"deal-making\" part of transactional leadership. (Effective, but not exceptional)\n\nTransformational Leadership (The \"Four I's\"):\n- Individualized Consideration: Mentoring and coaching.\n- Intellectual Stimulation: Encouraging creativity and challenging old ideas.\n- Inspirational Motivation: Communicating a compelling vision.\n- Idealized Influence: Being a role model with high ethical standards.

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Why (A) is Correct: This question refers to Likert's System of Management. The Benevolent-Authoritative (System 2) style is like a master-servant relationship. The manager is paternalistic and acts in a \"benevolent\" or kind way, but they fundamentally do not trust their subordinates with important decisions. They believe they know what's best for the employees. This leads to a condescending form of trust—they trust them to carry out orders, but not to think for themselves.\n\nWhy (B), (C), and (D) are Incorrect or Less Precise:\n\n(B) Gives economic or ego awards: This is a feature of the style, but (A) describes the underlying attitude that drives the behavior, making it a more fundamental characteristic.\n\n(C) Communicates downward: This is also a feature, but it's a characteristic of both Exploitative-Authoritative (System 1) and Benevolent-Authoritative (System 2). Option (A) specifically defines the tone of the Benevolent style.\n\n(D) Allows decision making among subordinates: This is explicitly what a Benevolent-Authoritative manager does not do for any significant decisions. This behavior is characteristic of the Consultative (System 3) and Participative (System 4) styles.",
    "additional": "Future Test Focus & Additional Concepts:\n\nLikert's Four Systems of Management:\n\nSystem 1: Exploitative-Authoritative: The manager uses fear and threats. Communication is downward only. There is no trust. Decisions are made at the top. (Pure autocrat).\n\nSystem 2: Benevolent-Authoritative: The manager uses rewards and a paternalistic attitude. Communication is mostly downward. There is condescending, master-servant trust. Some minor decisions may be allowed at lower levels, but all important ones are made at the top.\n\nSystem 3: Consultative: The manager uses rewards and occasional involvement in decisions. Communication flows both up and down. There is substantial, but not complete, trust. The manager consults with subordinates before making decisions but retains the final say.\n\nSystem 4: Participative-Group: The manager fosters a team environment. Communication flows up, down, and sideways. There is complete trust and confidence. Decision-making is spread throughout the organization, often through group processes.\n\nMcGregor's Theory X and Theory Y:\nTheory X Manager: Assumes employees are inherently lazy, dislike work, and need to be controlled and directed. This manager would use an Authoritative style (Likert System 1 or 2).\nTheory Y Manager: Assumes employees are self-motivated, enjoy work, and will seek responsibility if given the opportunity.

The other options contain incorrect elements like \"time.\"",
    "additional": "Future Test Focus & Additional Concepts:\n\nThe Five Rights of Delegation (In Detail):\n\nRight Task: Is this task appropriate to delegate? It should be routine, have a predictable outcome, require minimal problem-solving, and not involve nursing judgment or assessment. You cannot delegate tasks that are part of the nursing process (Assessment, Diagnosis, Planning, Evaluation) or require clinical judgment.\n\nRight Circumstance: Is the patient setting appropriate? Is the patient stable? Are the necessary resources and supervision available?\n\nRight Person: Is this delegate (e.g., a Nursing Assistant, LPN/LVN) competent to perform the task? Does it fall within their scope of practice and job description?\n\nRight Direction/Communication: Did you provide a clear, concise, and complete explanation of the task? This includes the objective, timeline, what to report, and any patient-specific instructions.\n\nRight Supervision/Evaluation: Did you appropriately monitor the delegate, evaluate the outcome of the task, and provide constructive feedback? The delegating nurse retains ultimate accountability for the task.\n\nDelegation Scenarios: The most common exam questions are scenarios. \"Which of the following tasks can the RN delegate to the Unlicensed Assistive Personnel (UAP)?\"\n\nCan Delegate to UAP: Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) like bathing, feeding (a stable patient), positioning, ambulation, taking vital signs (on a stable patient), recording intake and output.\n\nCannot Delegate to UAP: Medication administration, inserting IVs, patient teaching, performing assessments, interpreting data, developing a care plan."

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This question asks for the most significant red flag for drug diversion (theft of medication for personal use).\n\nd. The nurse in question frequently wastes medications. This is a major indicator. A nurse may document that a partial dose of a controlled substance was \"wasted\" (e.g., if a 2mg dose is ordered and the vial contains 4mg), but instead of properly disposing of the remainder, they divert it for themselves. Frequent or excessive wasting, especially without a witness signature as required by policy, is highly suspicious.\n\nOther common signs include volunteering to give pain medications for other nurses' patients, patients complaining of unrelieved pain despite receiving medication, frequent trips to the bathroom or supply closet after handling narcotics, and changes in mood or performance.\n\nDistractor Rationale: The other options are less specific. A nurse requesting a large assignment (a) or declining breaks (c) could be a dedicated employee. Preferring not to be the med nurse (b) is the opposite of a behavior typical of diversion.",

The leader encourages discussion and feedback. This style builds morale, fosters teamwork, and often leads to better, more creative decisions because it incorporates multiple perspectives. Its main drawback is that it is time-consuming. Therefore, it is the BEST style to use when there is time.\n\nAutocratic (or Authoritarian): The leader makes decisions independently with little or no input from others. This style is fast and efficient, making it the best choice in an emergency or crisis when a decision is needed immediately (e.g., during a cardiac arrest).\n\nLaissez-faire: The leader provides little or no direction and gives the group complete freedom. This style is effective only with a team that is highly mature, experienced, and self-motivated.\n\nSituational: This is a leadership theory, not a single style. It proposes that the most effective leaders adapt their style (e.g., from autocratic to democratic) based on the situation and the maturity level of their followers. While this is an effective overall approach, democratic is the best specific style for the condition given (having time).",
