    "question": "The nurse is aware that rigidity of patient’s chest wall during anesthesia is an adverse effect of which of the following medication",
    "options": {
      "A": "Propofol",
      "B": "Ketamine",
      "C": "Diazepam",
      "D": "Fentanyl"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Fentanyl, a potent opioid analgesic, can cause 'wooden chest syndrome' or thoracic rigidity, especially when administered in high doses or too rapidly. This is a known and potentially serious complication of opioid anesthesia, affecting ventilatory mechanics and requiring prompt intervention. It involves stiffening of respiratory muscles, making ventilation difficult unless managed by muscle relaxants or naloxone.\n\nPropofol (A) is associated with hypotension and apnea, not rigidity. Ketamine (B) causes dissociative anesthesia and maintains respiratory drive. Diazepam (C), a benzodiazepine, causes sedation and muscle relaxation, not rigidity.",
    "additional": "NCK twist: They may reword this scenario to describe symptoms during surgery, such as 'difficulty ventilating due to chest tightness despite patent airway' — hinting at fentanyl-induced rigidity.\n\nYou may also be asked about the reversal agents: e.g., \"Which drug is used to manage opioid-induced muscle rigidity during anesthesia?\" (Answer: Naloxone or neuromuscular blocker).\n\nAlso remember that rapid IV push of fentanyl increases this risk.\n\nRelated units: Critical care nursing, Pharmacology of anesthetics.\n\nText Ref: Brunner & Suddarth’s Medical-Surgical Nursing, Ch. 17 (Preoperative and Intraoperative Care)"

    "question": "Which one of the following preoperative lab results of a theatre patient may necessitate the nurse to call the surgeon:",
    "options": {
      "A": "Platelets count of 250000/mm",
      "B": "Total cholesterol of 325 mg/dl",
      "C": "Blood urea nitrogen of 25mg/dl",
      "D": "Hemoglobin 12.8mg/dl"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "A total cholesterol of 325 mg/dl is significantly elevated and may indicate cardiovascular risk. Although it is not an absolute contraindication for surgery, it is important in cardiac risk stratification. The nurse must report this because it could affect anesthesia safety or require further workup.\n\nThe other lab values are within or near normal ranges: Platelets at 250,000/mm3 is normal; BUN at 25 is slightly elevated but not critical; Hemoglobin 12.8 mg/dl is within normal limits for many adults, especially females.",
    "additional": "NCK twist: They might describe the scenario in a case format — e.g., 'A 58-year-old obese male scheduled for hernia repair has a cholesterol level of 325 mg/dl. What is the best action?' — Answer: Notify surgeon.\n\nThey may also flip the question to ask 'Which of the following is **not** a priority to report?' or mix lab values across systems (e.g., coagulation profile + BUN + CBC).\n\nAlso review: ASA classification, cardiac risk indicators, and surgical clearance protocols.\n\nRelated topics: Preoperative nursing assessment, Lab interpretation, Surgical risk factors."

      "C": "Supine",
      "D": "Lateral"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The lateral position is used for surgeries involving the chest, kidney, or hip. It allows optimal access and visualization of lateral structures. For instance, nephrectomies (kidney removal) or thoracotomies are commonly performed in this position.\n\nLithotomy (A) is for pelvic or perineal procedures. Trendelenburg (B) enhances exposure to lower abdomen and pelvis. Supine (C) is common but does not provide the lateral access needed for kidney, hip, or thoracic surgery.",
    "additional": "NCK twist: You may see this tested as a match-the-position type, e.g., 'Match the surgery to the correct position.'\n\nAnother variation: 'What position increases risk for brachial plexus injury in lateral surgeries?' — Answer: Lateral decubitus.\n\nAlso expect related questions on pressure areas in lateral position (e.g., trochanter, shoulder, ear).\n\nRelated topics: Operating room safety, Intraoperative positioning complications, OR nursing responsibilities."

      "C": "Aorta Coarctation",
      "D": "Pulmonary stenosis"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Truncus arteriosus is a congenital heart defect where a single large vessel arises from the heart instead of two separate pulmonary artery and aorta. This causes severe mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, leading to systemic hypoxia. It is a cyanotic heart lesion and often incompatible with life without urgent surgical intervention, hence why a newborn may die shortly after birth.\n\nThe other conditions are also congenital heart defects but may be compatible with life for a longer period: Patent ductus arteriosus (B), Coarctation of the aorta (C), and Pulmonary stenosis (D) can all lead to varying severity but are not immediately fatal at birth in most cases.",
    "additional": "NCK twist: The exam may ask for which congenital heart condition leads to 'mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood' or present with 'central cyanosis within minutes of birth'.\n\nThey might also test on which ones are 'acyanotic vs cyanotic defects'.\n\nRelated review: Congenital Heart Defects (CHD), Cyanotic vs Acyanotic lesions, Cardiac anomalies in pediatrics."

      "D": "0.5 mg for term baby and 1 mg for preterm baby"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Vitamin K prophylaxis is crucial to prevent Vitamin K Deficiency Bleeding (VKDB) in neonates. The standard dosage is:\n- 1 mg IM for term babies\n- 0.5 mg IM for preterm babies\nThis is because preterm infants are smaller and more vulnerable to overdose or bleeding complications.\n\nVitamin K is essential for hepatic synthesis of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X. Newborns are deficient due to immature liver enzymes and lack of gut flora.",
    "additional": "NCK twist: The question might describe a baby with signs of bleeding (e.g., bleeding umbilical stump, bruises, or intracranial hemorrhage) and ask what was missed at birth — answer would be Vitamin K.\n\nMay also appear as a select-all-that-apply: 'What is the importance of Vitamin K in newborns?'\n\nKey related topics: Neonatal pharmacology, Preventive newborn care, Hemorrhagic disease of the newborn (HDN)."

      "D": "Placenta abruption, multiple pregnancy, intra-uterine foetal death"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "DIC is a pathological process characterized by widespread activation of clotting cascade, leading to consumption of clotting factors and platelets, resulting in bleeding and thrombosis.\n\nIn obstetrics, key precipitating events include:\n- Amniotic fluid embolism: triggers systemic inflammation\n- Placental abruption: massive tissue factor release\n- Eclampsia: systemic endothelial injury and inflammatory response\n\nOptions C and D contain contributing but not primary precipitating factors.",
    "additional": "NCK twist: They may ask for lab indicators (e.g., low platelets, prolonged PT/INR, elevated D-dimers) or clinical presentation (e.g., bleeding gums, petechiae, oozing from IV site).\n\nAlternate format: Case-based scenario with postpartum bleeding and lab results pointing to DIC.\n\nYou should also study: Management (Fresh frozen plasma, platelets, treat cause), ICU care, and DIC stages.\n\nRelated Units: Midwifery, Emergency Obstetrics, Hematology."

      "C": "I will wait and take my calcium supplements 2 hours after I take my iron supplement",
      "D": "This medication can cause constipation. So, I will drink plenty of fluids and take a stool softer as needed"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Iron absorption is enhanced in an acidic environment — orange juice (rich in Vitamin C) increases iron bioavailability. So, avoiding it would hinder absorption. This statement shows a misunderstanding.\n\nCorrect practices include:\n- Take on empty stomach for better absorption (A), unless GI irritation occurs.\n- Avoid co-administering calcium and iron; they compete for absorption (C).\n- Constipation is a common side effect; fluids/stool softeners help (D).",
    "additional": "NCK twist: May test food interactions (e.g., 'Which of the following meals should be avoided when taking iron supplements?' — Answer: Milk, tea).\n\nThey may also reverse the question: 'Which statement shows correct understanding?' or give lab data showing persistent anemia despite compliance — indicating poor absorption.\n\nReview related pharmacokinetics, patient counseling points, and drug-nutrient interactions.\n\nConnected units: Pharmacology, Nutritional disorders, Patient education."

      "C": "Hyperchromic and macrocytic",
      "D": "Hypochromic and macrocytic"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Iron deficiency anemia results in:\n- Hypochromia: decreased hemoglobin content makes cells pale\n- Microcytosis: cells are smaller than normal due to impaired hemoglobin synthesis\n\nThese changes are classic findings on peripheral blood smear. Hyperchromia and macrocytosis are typical of B12 or folate deficiency anemias.",
    "additional": "NCK twist: May provide an image or description of a blood smear and ask you to identify the type of anemia.\n\nAlternate format: A case study with symptoms like fatigue, pica (eating clay), brittle nails, and a blood smear showing pale, small RBCs.\n\nAlso know lab findings: Low MCV, low MCHC, high TIBC, low ferritin.\n\nConnected units: Hematology, Nutrition, Pathology."

      "C": "Koilonychias",
      "D": "Leukonychia"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Koilonychia (spoon-shaped nails) is a classical sign of chronic iron deficiency anemia. The patient's history of gastric bypass (which impairs iron absorption) and symptoms like pica (eating non-food substances such as clay/dirt) and fatigue strongly support this diagnosis.\n\nOther nail findings:\n- Terry’s nails (A): associated with liver disease\n- Onychoschizia (B): nail splitting\n- Leukonychia (D): white spots, often benign or due to trauma",

      "C": "Spleen",
      "D": "Peyer’s patches"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Peyer's patches are lymphoid nodules located in the small intestine, particularly the ileum. They contain macrophages and lymphocytes which help detect and destroy pathogens entering via the gut, thus preventing systemic infection.\n\nThe spleen (C) filters blood, not gut content. Tubal tonsils (A) protect the nasopharynx. Thymus (B) is for T-cell maturation but not gut immune defense.",
