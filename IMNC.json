    "question": "A newborn is diagnosed with a congenital heart defect (CHD). What should the nurse assess for as a common early sign of CHD in newborns?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Cyanosis",
      "B": "Feeding difficulties",
      "C": "Hypertension",
      "D": "Bradycardia"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This question asks for a common early sign of CHD. While severe defects can present with obvious cyanosis at birth, a more subtle and very common early indicator is difficulty with feeding.\n\nFeeding Difficulties: Infants with significant CHD often have poor cardiac output and increased metabolic demand. The act of feeding (sucking, swallowing, and breathing) is strenuous work for a baby. An infant with CHD may:\n- Tire easily during feeds.\n- Take a long time to finish a small amount.\n- Become diaphoretic (sweaty) on the forehead during feeding.\n- Fall asleep mid-feed.\n- Exhibit rapid breathing (tachypnea) or shortness of breath.\nThese feeding issues often lead to poor weight gain or failure to thrive.\n\nCyanosis (A): A classic sign, but it is typically associated with specific types of \"cyanotic\" heart defects (e.g., Tetralogy of Fallot) and may not be the earliest sign in \"acyanotic\" defects (e.g., VSD, ASD).\n\nHypertension (C): High blood pressure is not a typical sign of most CHDs in newborns; in fact, hypotension might be seen in severe obstructive lesions. An exception is Coarctation of the Aorta, which causes high BP in the upper extremities and low BP in the lower extremities.\n\nBradycardia (D): Slow heart rate is uncommon. Tachycardia (fast heart rate) is a much more common compensatory mechanism.",
    "additional": "1. Acyanotic vs. Cyanotic Defects:\n\nThis is a fundamental way to classify CHDs.\n\nAcyanotic Defects (Pink Babies): Involve a left-to-right shunt of blood (oxygenated blood from the left side of the heart shunts over to the right side). This increases pulmonary blood flow but does not cause cyanosis. They present with signs of congestive heart failure (CHF).\n\nExamples: Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD), Atrial Septal Defect (ASD), Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA).\n\nKey Signs: Tachypnea, tachycardia, poor feeding, poor weight gain, diaphoresis, hepatomegaly.\n\nCyanotic Defects (Blue Babies): Involve a right-to-left shunt (deoxygenated blood from the right side shunts to the left side and out to the body). This decreases pulmonary blood flow and causes cyanosis.\n\nExamples: Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), Transposition of the Great Arteries (TGA).\n\nKey Signs: Cyanosis, clubbing of fingers (in older children), \"tet spells\" (hypercyanotic episodes).\n\nFuture Question Idea: \"A nurse is assessing an infant with a large Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD). Which of the following findings would the nurse most expect?\" (Answer: A loud, harsh murmur at the left sternal border, or signs of heart failure like tachypnea)."

    "question": "A 10-year-old child with type 1 diabetes experiences a hypoglycemic episode at school. What is the nurse's immediate action?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Administering glucagon",
      "B": "Providing the child with a sugary snack",
      "C": "Waiting for the child to recover on their own",
      "D": "Calling 911 for emergency assistance"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This question tests the management of mild to moderate hypoglycemia in a conscious child.\n\nHypoglycemia: Low blood sugar (typically < 70 mg/dL or < 3.9 mmol/L).\n\nImmediate Action for a CONSCIOUS patient: The priority is to raise the blood sugar quickly. The \"Rule of 15\" is the standard protocol:\n- Give 15 grams of a simple, fast-acting carbohydrate.\n- Wait 15 minutes and re-check the blood glucose.\n- If still low, repeat the 15 grams of carbohydrate.\n\nExamples of 15g Fast-Acting Carbs: 1/2 cup (120 mL) of fruit juice or regular soda, 3-4 glucose tablets, or 1 tablespoon of sugar or honey.\n\nAdministering Glucagon (A): This is reserved for a severe hypoglycemic event where the child is unconscious, unable to swallow, or having a seizure. Glucagon is an injectable hormone that stimulates the liver to release stored glucose.\n\nWaiting (C) is dangerous as hypoglycemia can progress to seizure and coma.\n\nCalling 911 (D) is only necessary if the child is unconscious or glucagon is unavailable.",
    "additional": "1. The \"Rule of 15\" Follow-up:\n\nOnce the blood glucose has returned to a safe level, it is crucial to give the child a complex carbohydrate and a protein snack (e.g., crackers with cheese or peanut butter).\n\nReason: The simple sugar will provide a quick spike in glucose, but it will wear off quickly. The complex carb/protein snack will prevent the blood sugar from dropping again.\n\n2. Signs and Symptoms of Hypoglycemia:\n\nAdrenergic (early signs): Shaking, sweating, tachycardia, anxiety, hunger, pallor.\n\nNeuroglycopenic (late signs, as brain is deprived of glucose): Drowsiness, confusion, irritability, headache, blurred vision, slurred speech, seizure, coma.\n\nFuture Question Idea: \"After treating a conscious child's hypoglycemic episode with fruit juice, what is the nurse's next action once the blood sugar is normal?\" (Answer: Provide a snack of crackers and cheese)."

    "question": "A 7-year-old child is prescribed amoxicillin for a streptococcal throat infection. The nurse should instruct the parents to:",
    "options": {
      "A": "Give the antibiotic with milk",
      "B": "Administer the entire course, even if the child feels better",
      "C": "Stop the medication if the child develops diarrhea",
      "D": "Keep the medication for future use"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This is a critical patient education point for all antibiotic therapy.\n\nCompleting the Course: The full course of antibiotics is necessary to eradicate all the bacteria. Symptoms often improve within a few days as the number of bacteria decreases, but some bacteria remain. Stopping the medication early allows these remaining bacteria to survive and multiply, which can lead to a relapse of the infection or, more dangerously, the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\n\nGiving with milk (A): Generally acceptable for amoxicillin, but not the most critical instruction. Some antibiotics (like tetracyclines) should not be given with dairy.\n\nDiarrhea (C): Mild diarrhea is a common side effect of antibiotics. Parents should be instructed to call the provider if it is severe, but not to stop the medication on their own.\n\nKeeping for future use (D): This is dangerous practice. It encourages self-diagnosis and can lead to using the wrong antibiotic for an illness or using an expired drug.",
    "additional": "1. Antibiotic Stewardship:\n\nThis is a major global health initiative that nurses play a key role in.\n\nConcept: A coordinated effort to improve the appropriate use of antimicrobials. This includes promoting the selection of the right drug, dose, and duration of therapy.\n\nKey Nursing Roles:\n\n- Educating patients and families on the importance of completing the full course.\n- Teaching the difference between viral and bacterial infections and explaining why antibiotics don't work for viruses (like the common cold).\n- Monitoring for side effects and effectiveness of therapy.\n\nFuture Question Idea: \"A nurse is teaching a parent about a newly prescribed antibiotic for their child's otitis media. Which statement by the parent indicates a need for further teaching?\" (Answer: \"I will stop giving the medicine as soon as my child's fever is gone.\")."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This question tests knowledge of age-appropriate developmental milestones.\n\n2 Months:\n\nSocial/Emotional: Begins to develop a social smile. Coos and makes gurgling sounds.\n\nGross Motor: Can hold their head up and begins to push up when lying on tummy.\n\nFine Motor: Follows objects with eyes.\n\nRolling Over (A): Typically occurs around 4-6 months.\n\nCrawling and Pulling to Stand (C): Typically occurs around 8-10 months.\n\nSpeaking in Short Sentences (D): Typically occurs around 18-24 months.",
    "additional": "1. Key Developmental Milestones (A quick reference):\n\n- 4 Months: Babbles, holds head steady, brings hands to mouth, may roll from tummy to back.\n- 6 Months: Responds to own name, sits without support, rolls over in both directions, starts to eat solid foods.\n- 9 Months: Understands \"no,\" has stranger anxiety, crawls, pulls to stand, has pincer grasp (thumb and index finger).\n- 12 Months (1 Year): Says \"mama\" and \"dada,\" waves \"bye-bye,\" may stand alone or take a few steps, uses cup.\n- 18 Months: Says several single words, points to show what they want, walks alone.\n- 2 Years: Speaks in 2-4 word sentences, follows simple instructions, kicks a ball, starts to run.\n\nFuture Question Idea: \"During a 9-month well-child visit, which of the following findings would be a developmental red flag requiring further evaluation?\"\n\nA) Is not yet walking independently.\nB) Does not respond to their own name.\nC) Cries when parents leave the room.\nD) Cannot yet speak in full sentences.\n\n(Correct Answer: B) Not responding to one's name by 9 months can be a sign of hearing impairment or a developmental disorder like autism. The other options are within the normal range of development."

    "question": "A 15-year-old adolescent reports feeling down, losing interest in hobbies, and having trouble sleeping. What should be the nurse's initial assessment regarding these symptoms?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Screen for depression",
      "B": "Recommend more physical activity",
      "C": "Assess for substance abuse",
      "D": "Encourage the adolescent to socialize more"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The constellation of symptoms presented—low mood (feeling down), anhedonia (losing interest in hobbies), and sleep disturbance—are core signs of depression.\n\nInitial Action: Assessment. Before making recommendations, the nurse must first assess the situation. The most direct and appropriate initial assessment is to screen for depression using a validated tool.\n\nB, C, and D might be part of a treatment plan later, but they are interventions, not assessments. Furthermore, recommending these without a proper assessment is premature. For example, the adolescent's symptoms could be related to substance abuse (C), and simply encouraging them to socialize (D) may not be helpful and could be dismissive of their underlying distress.",
    "additional": "1. Screening Tools for Adolescent Depression:\n\n- PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9): A commonly used, validated, self-administered questionnaire for screening and monitoring depression. A modified version (PHQ-A) is available for adolescents.\n\n- HEADSS Assessment: A psychosocial screening tool for adolescents that covers Home, Education/Employment, Activities, Drugs/Substances, Sexuality, and Suicide/Depression. This provides a broader context for the adolescent's mental health.\n\n2. Suicide Risk Assessment:\n\nAnytime a nurse screens for depression, they must also screen for suicidality.\n\nThis involves asking direct questions in a non-judgmental way:\n\n\"Have you had thoughts that you would be better off dead or of hurting yourself in some way?\"\n\nIf yes: \"Have you had thoughts about taking your own life?\"\n\nIf yes: \"Have you thought about how you might do this?

    "question": "A 9-year-old child is prescribed methylphenidate (Ritalin) for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The nurse should educate the parents about potential side effects, including:",
    "options": {
      "A": "Weight gain",
      "B": "Insomnia",
      "C": "Decreased appetite",
      "D": "Bradycardia"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Methylphenidate (Ritalin) is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant, which is the most common class of medication used to treat ADHD. As stimulants, they increase the levels of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain, which helps to improve focus and decrease impulsivity. However, they also have predictable side effects related to their stimulant properties.\n\nDecreased Appetite & Weight Loss (C): This is one of the most common side effects. The medication can suppress hunger, leading to poor intake, especially during the middle of the day. This can result in weight loss or poor weight gain, which is a major concern in growing children.\n\nInsomnia (B): Another very common side effect. The stimulant effect can make it difficult for the child to fall asleep, especially if the medication is taken too late in the day.\n\nWeight Gain (A): The opposite is true. Weight loss is the concern.\n\nBradycardia (D): Stimulants cause an increase in heart rate (tachycardia) and blood pressure, not a decrease.",
    "additional": "1. Nursing Management of Methylphenidate Side Effects:\n\nAppetite/Weight:\n- Monitor the child's height and weight regularly.\n- Administer the medication with or after a meal (e.g., breakfast) to minimize the impact on appetite.\n- Encourage nutrient-dense foods and high-calorie snacks when the child is hungry (e.g., in the evening after the medication has worn off).\n\nInsomnia:\n- Administer the last dose of the day no later than the early afternoon (e.g., before 4 PM).\n- Establish a consistent, relaxing bedtime routine.\n\nOther Side Effects: Headache, stomachache, irritability.\n\n2. \"Drug Holidays\":\n\nSometimes, a healthcare provider may recommend a \"drug holiday\" (e.g., not taking the medication on weekends or during school breaks).\n\nPurpose: To assess if the medication is still needed and to allow for a \"catch-up\" in growth and weight if appetite suppression is a problem. This should only be done under the direction of the prescribing provider.\n\nFuture Question Idea: \"A parent is concerned that their child on methylphenidate is not eating lunch at school. What is the nurse's best advice?\" (Answer: \"Give the child a large, healthy breakfast before the morning dose and offer a substantial snack or meal in the evening.\")."

    "question": "A 14-year-old adolescent has a suspected diagnosis of bulimia nervosa. What is the primary focus of nursing care for this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Monitoring electrolyte levels",
      "B": "Promoting weight gain",
      "C": "Addressing distorted body image",
      "D": "Teaching assertiveness skills"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This question asks for the primary focus, which in nursing always relates to physiological safety first (Maslow's hierarchy of needs).\n\nBulimia Nervosa: An eating disorder characterized by a cycle of binge eating followed by compensatory behaviors (purging) to prevent weight gain. Purging can include self-induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives or diuretics, or excessive exercise.\n\nPhysiological Instability: The most immediate life-threatening complications of bulimia nervosa are a direct result of purging. Frequent vomiting or laxative/diuretic abuse leads to significant loss of fluids and electrolytes.\n\nMonitoring Electrolyte Levels (A): This is the top priority. Hypokalemia (low potassium) is particularly dangerous and can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death. Other imbalances include hyponatremia and metabolic alkalosis.\n\nB, C, and D are all very important long-term therapeutic goals, but physiological stability must be established first. Addressing distorted body image (C) is the core psychological issue, but it is not the immediate priority over potential cardiac arrest. Promoting weight gain (B) is more central to the treatment of anorexia nervosa, as patients with bulimia are often of normal weight or slightly overweight.",
    "additional": "1. Physical Assessment Findings in Bulimia Nervosa:\n\n- Dental Caries/Enamel Erosion: From stomach acid during vomiting.\n- Parotid Gland Enlargement: Swelling of the salivary glands.\n- Russell's Sign: Calluses or scars on the knuckles from inducing vomiting.\n- Esophagitis or esophageal tears.\n- Cardiac Arrhythmias on an ECG due to electrolyte imbalance.\n\n2. Nursing Interventions:\n\n- Establish a structured meal plan: Three meals and two to three snacks per day.\n- Supervise after meals: Monitor the patient for 1–2 hours after eating to prevent purging behaviors.\n- Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT): The leading evidence-based psychotherapy for bulimia.\n- Medication: SSRIs (like fluoxetine) are often effective in reducing the binge-purge cycle.\n\nFuture Question Idea: \"A nurse is reviewing the lab results for a patient newly admitted with bulimia nervosa. Which finding requires immediate reporting to the physician?\" (Answer: A serum potassium level of 2.8 mEq/L)."

      "C": "Immediately after meals",
      "D": "At least 1 hour before or after meals"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This question addresses the correct timing for a crucial therapy in cystic fibrosis (CF) management.\n\nCystic Fibrosis (CF): A genetic disorder that causes the production of abnormally thick, sticky mucus, which clogs the lungs and digestive system.\n\nChest Physiotherapy (CPT): A technique (including postural drainage, percussion, and vibration) used to loosen the thick mucus in the lungs, so it can be coughed out.\n\nCorrect Timing: CPT can induce coughing and gagging. Performing it immediately after a meal (C) can cause vomiting and increase the risk of aspiration. Performing it immediately before a meal (A) can leave the child too tired or nauseated to eat. Therefore, the best practice is to schedule CPT for a time that does not interfere with meals, typically at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after eating.",
    "additional": "1. Comprehensive Management of CF:\nCF requires a multi-faceted treatment plan.\n\nAirway Clearance:\n- CPT\n- High-frequency chest wall oscillation (a vibrating vest).\n- Bronchodilators (e.g., albuterol) are often given before CPT to open the airways.\n- Mucolytics (e.g., dornase alfa/Pulmozyme) are inhaled medications that thin the mucus.\n\nPancreatic Enzyme Replacement:\n- The thick mucus also blocks the pancreatic ducts, preventing digestive enzymes from reaching the intestine. This causes malabsorption of fats and proteins.\n- Patients must take pancreatic enzyme supplements (e.g., Creon, Pancreaze) with every meal and snack to be able to digest food and absorb nutrients.\n\nNutrition:\n- Patients require a high-calorie, high-fat, high-protein diet to meet their increased metabolic needs and overcome malabsorption.\n- Fat-soluble vitamin (A, D, E, K) supplements are necessary.\n\nFuture Question Idea: \"A nurse is administering medications to a child with cystic fibrosis who is about to eat lunch. Which medication must be given at this time?\" (Answer: Pancreatic enzymes)."

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "EXPLANATION based on Kenyan (KEPI) Schedule:\nAt 6 months, the child is not typically due for a scheduled vaccine. Let's review the schedule around this age:\n\nBirth: BCG, OPV-0, Hep B\n\n6 Weeks: OPV-1, DPT-HepB-Hib 1 (Pentavalent), PCV-10 1, Rota 1\n\n10 Weeks: OPV-2, DPT-HepB-Hib 2 (Pentavalent), PCV-10 2, Rota 2\n\n14 Weeks: OPV-3, DPT-HepB-Hib 3 (Pentavalent), PCV-10 3, IPV\n\n9 Months: Measles-Rubella (MR) 1\n\n18 Months: Measles-Rubella (MR) 2\n\nGiven the options provided in the question:\n\nB) DTP and C) Hepatitis B: Both are part of the Pentavalent vaccine given at 6, 10, and 14 weeks. A 6-month-old might be coming in late for their 14-week shots, making these plausible.\n\nA) MMR: Given at 9 months and 18 months in Kenya (as MR). Not due at 6 months.\n\nD) HPV: Given to older children (around age 10).\n\nThe question is slightly flawed in its timing. However, both DTP and Hep B are key vaccines in the infant series. If we must choose the best fit, the core infant series (DPT, Hep B, Hib, Polio, PCV) is the focus of the first few months of life. The rationale picking C is reasonable as Hep B is part of that series.\n\nNote: In other countries (like the US), a 6-month visit often includes the 3rd dose of DTaP, Hep B, Hib, PCV, and Rotavirus, making the timing more accurate for those schedules.",

    "explanation": "This question tests the application of the ETAT triage system. The ETAT (Emergency Triage Assessment and Treatment) system is designed to rapidly identify the sickest children who need immediate life-saving interventions.\n\nTriage System: Children are categorized based on the presence of Emergency Signs and Priority Signs.\n\nEmergency Signs (ABC issues): Any child with an emergency sign is triaged as RED (or Priority 1). These are life-threatening conditions requiring immediate treatment. The key emergency signs are:\n- Airway: Obstructed or gasping breathing.\n- Breathing: Severe respiratory distress (e.g., central cyanosis, grunting, severe chest in-drawing).\n- Circulation: Signs of shock (cold hands, capillary refill > 3 seconds, weak/fast pulse).\n- Coma/Convulsions/Confusion: Altered level of consciousness.\n- Severe Dehydration.\n\nThe child in the scenario presents with difficulty breathing and a severe cough, which qualifies as severe respiratory distress, an emergency sign. Therefore, the child must be triaged as RED.",

    "explanation": "The primary purpose of the 'B' (Breathing) assessment in the ETAT A-B-C-D approach is to identify life-threatening breathing problems.\n\nAssessing for Distress (C) is the broader goal, but the formal step in ETAT includes quantifying the breathing effort through rate and oxygen saturation. These help determine the presence and severity of hypoxia.\n\nThus, while C captures the purpose generally, D directly refers to the measurable outcomes used to make triage decisions. Measuring respiratory rate and SpO2 supports the identification of respiratory failure and guides oxygen therapy.",

    "explanation": "Acute gastroenteritis leads to fluid and electrolyte loss through diarrhea and vomiting. In young children, this can rapidly lead to severe dehydration, hypovolemic shock, and death. Therefore, the absolute number one priority in managing the child is to prevent or treat dehydration. All other goals are secondary to this life-saving intervention.\n\nB (Lethargy) is a symptom of dehydration; treating dehydration will resolve it.\n\nC (Skin integrity) is important (risk of diaper rash) but not a primary life-saving goal.\n\nD (Maintaining comfort) is a valid nursing goal but comes after ensuring physiological stability.",

    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This question differentiates between the two major forms of severe acute malnutrition (SAM).\n\nMarasmus is caused by a severe deficiency of all nutrients, especially energy (calories). It is essentially starvation. The child appears as \"skin and bones\" (severe wasting) but is often alert and has a voracious or good appetite. There is no oedema.\n\nKwashiorkor is caused primarily by inadequate protein intake relative to calories. The hallmark sign is bilateral pitting oedema, which typically starts in the feet and legs and can become generalized. These children are often irritable, apathetic, and have a poor appetite. They may also have skin changes (flaky-paint dermatosis), hair changes, and an enlarged fatty liver.",
    "additional": "Marasmic-Kwashiorkor: A mixed form with features of both (wasting and oedema).\n\nWasting vs. Stunting:\n\nWasting (Low Weight-for-Height): Indicates acute malnutrition.\n\nStunting (Low Height-for-Age): Indicates chronic malnutrition.\n\nManagement of SAM: Involves careful refeeding with therapeutic formulas like F-75 (starter phase) and F-100 (catch-up phase) and managing complications like hypoglycemia, hypothermia, and infection.\n\nBook Tag: IMCI guidelines, WHO Guidelines for Management of Severe Acute Malnutrition."

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "While all the options are relevant to the holistic care of an HIV-positive client, option A highlights a critical pharmacological issue that directly impacts the effectiveness of family planning.\n\nMany Antiretroviral drugs (ARVs), particularly Efavirenz and Nevirapine (NNRTIs), and protease inhibitors, are enzyme inducers.\n\nRifampicin, a cornerstone drug for treating Tuberculosis (which is a common co-infection with HIV), is a very potent enzyme inducer.\n\nThese drugs speed up the metabolism of hormonal contraceptives (pills, implants, injectables) in the liver, reducing their blood levels and leading to a high risk of contraceptive failure. Therefore, this drug-drug interaction is a paramount consideration.",
    "additional": "Counseling Implications:\n\n- A woman on Efavirenz or Rifampicin-based regimens should be counseled that hormonal methods may not be effective.\n- Dual method protection should be emphasized: Use a reliable method for pregnancy prevention (like an IUD or consistent condom use) AND condoms for STI/HIV prevention.\n- The copper IUD and hormonal IUDs (Mirena) are excellent choices as their effectiveness is not reduced by these drugs.

    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Mixed feeding (giving an infant breast milk along with other foods or liquids like formula, water, or porridge before 6 months of age) is the most dangerous feeding option in the context of HIV. It is thought to irritate the infant's gut lining, making it more permeable to the virus in the breast milk, thereby significantly increasing the risk of transmission. The WHO and national guidelines are unequivocal: \"Exclusive Breastfeeding\" or \"Exclusive Replacement Feeding.\" You must never mix the two.\n\nA and B are components of safe breastfeeding, but avoiding mixed feeding (C) is the most critical single piece of feeding advice.\n\nD is partially correct (exclusive breastfeeding is key), but the emphasis on avoiding mixed feeding is the most crucial message to prevent transmission.",
    "additional": "Current PMTCT Infant Feeding Guidelines (WHO Option B+):\n\n- All HIV-positive pregnant and breastfeeding women should be on lifelong Antiretroviral Therapy (ART).\n- With maternal ART, exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months is recommended, followed by continued breastfeeding with complementary foods up to 24 months or longer.\n- The infant should also receive ARV prophylaxis (e.g., daily Nevirapine) for at least 6 weeks.\n\nThe core principle is that the benefits of breastfeeding (nutrition, immunity) combined with the protective effect of maternal ART far outweigh the now very low risk of transmission.\n\nBook Tag: MOH National Guidelines for PMTCT of HIV/AIDS."

    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This question asks about the standard prophylactic (preventative) medications given to a newborn immediately after birth.\n\nVitamin K: Newborns have a sterile gut and cannot produce their own Vitamin K, which is essential for the synthesis of clotting factors in the liver. To prevent Hemorrhagic Disease of the Newborn (HDN), also known as Vitamin K Deficiency Bleeding (VKDB), a single intramuscular injection of Vitamin K is given. The standard dose for a term infant is 1 mg. A lower dose of 0.5 mg is typically reserved for preterm infants.\n\nEye Prophylaxis: To prevent Ophthalmia Neonatorum, an eye infection that can cause blindness, newborns receive prophylactic eye medication. This is primarily to protect against Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis acquired from the mother's birth canal. The standard preparations are 1% tetracycline or 0.5% erythromycin eye ointment.\n\nLet's evaluate the options based on these standards:\n\nOption (a): Incorrect dose for Vitamin K (0.5 mg is for preterm) and incorrect concentration for tetracycline.\n\nOption (b): Gentamicin is not the standard prophylactic eye agent.\n\nOption (c): Correct. It lists the standard concentration for tetracycline (1%) and the standard dose for Vitamin K (1 mg) for a term newborn.\n\nOption (d): Gentamicin is incorrect.",

If they do, it is the nurse's responsibility to educate them on the risks (bleeding, blindness) and to document the refusal clearly in the chart.\n\nOphthalmia Neonatorum:\n\nGonococcal: Very rapid onset (2-5 days), purulent discharge, can cause corneal ulceration and blindness quickly.\n\nChlamydial: Slower onset (5-14 days), watery discharge that becomes purulent. Most common cause today.\n\nHemorrhagic Disease of the Newborn (HDN):\n\nEarly-onset (within 24 hrs): Severe, often in infants of mothers on certain anticonvulsants.\n\nClassic (1-7 days): Bruising, GI bleeds, or bleeding from the umbilicus or injection sites.\n\nLate-onset (2-12 weeks): Most dangerous, often presents as intracranial hemorrhage, common in exclusively breastfed infants who did not receive Vitamin K prophylaxis."

    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This question addresses the management of an infant born to a mother with active tuberculosis (TB). The infant is at high risk of contracting TB.\n\nThe standard management is to provide prophylaxis to the infant to prevent them from developing active TB disease. The drug of choice is Isoniazid (INH).\n\nBCG Vaccine: The BCG vaccine is a live, attenuated vaccine. It should NOT be given to an infant who may already be infected with TB or is receiving INH prophylaxis, as its efficacy is uncertain in this context and it interferes with the interpretation of the Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) used for monitoring.\n\nOption (c) is the correct regimen according to many international and national guidelines. The infant receives Isoniazid prophylaxis for 6 months. After the 6-month period, the infant is re-evaluated (e.g., with a TST). If the TST is negative and there is no evidence of disease, the INH is stopped. The BCG vaccine can then be given if the TST is negative.\n\nOption (a) and (d): Giving BCG immediately is contraindicated.\n\nOption (b): Incorrect duration and frequency for INH prophylaxis.",
    "additional": "Management Protocol for Infant of TB Mother:\n\nAt Birth: Thoroughly examine the infant for signs of congenital TB (rare but serious).\n\nStart INH Prophylaxis: Begin Isoniazid (usually 5-10 mg/kg once daily).\n\nDefer BCG: Do not give the BCG vaccine at birth.\n\nBreastfeeding: Breastfeeding is generally encouraged as the risk of transmission through breast milk is minimal, and the mother's drugs are safe. The mother should wear a mask until she is no longer considered infectious.\n\nAfter 6 Months: Perform a Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) on the infant.\n\nIf TST is negative: Stop INH. The infant is considered uninfected. Administer BCG vaccine now.\n\nIf TST is positive: The infant is considered to have latent TB infection (LTBI). Investigate for active disease (e.g., chest X-ray). If no active disease, continue INH for a full course of treatment for LTBI (often 9 months total).

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This question asks for the definition of caput succedaneum, a common finding in newborns after a vaginal delivery. It's important to differentiate it from a cephalohematoma.\n\nOption (b) is the most accurate, though general, description. More specifically, a caput succedaneum is edema (swelling) of the soft tissues of the scalp caused by pressure from the cervix or vaginal wall during a prolonged or difficult labor.\n\nOption (a) describes a cephalohematoma. This is a collection of blood between the periosteum (the membrane covering the skull bone) and the skull bone itself. It is caused by the rupture of blood vessels during delivery.\n\nOption (c) is incorrect; the edema is in the scalp tissue above the periosteum, not of the periosteum itself.\n\nOption (d) is incorrect. It is a birth trauma, not a congenital abnormality (a structural defect present from conception).",

    "explanation": "Measles (Rubeola) is a highly contagious viral illness that can have severe complications, especially in young children and malnourished individuals.\n\nOption (e) lists three of the most common and serious complications:\n\nPneumonia: The most common cause of death from measles in young children. Can be a primary viral pneumonia or a secondary bacterial pneumonia.\n\nMalnutrition: The virus can cause diarrhea, vomiting, and sores in the mouth (stomatitis), leading to decreased food intake and nutrient loss. The infection itself also depletes Vitamin A stores, worsening the situation.\n\nBlindness: Measles is a leading cause of childhood blindness in developing countries, primarily due to the severe Vitamin A deficiency it induces, leading to xerophthalmia and corneal ulceration.\n\nOption (a): Encephalitis is a known complication, but deafness is more associated with mumps. Contractures are not a direct complication.\n\nOption (b): Paralysis and rectal prolapse are not typical complications.\n\nOption (c): PSE stands for Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis, a very rare, fatal, degenerative neurological disease that occurs 7-10 years after a measles infection.

The nurse must counsel the parent on expected, common side effects to reduce anxiety and ensure appropriate management.\n\nCommon Local Reactions: Redness, swelling, pain, or tenderness at the injection site. These are the most common side effects.\n\nCommon Systemic Reactions: Mild fever, irritability (unusual crying), drowsiness, and loss of appetite.\n\nLess Common/Rare Reactions: High fever (>39°C), persistent crying for more than 3 hours, vomiting/diarrhea.\n\nOption (a) and (b): Unusual crying (irritability) and loss of appetite are very common systemic side effects. Either could be considered correct. Irritability is often the most noticeable to parents.\n\nOption (c): Diarrhea and vomiting are listed as possible side effects but are generally less common than irritability, fever, or appetite loss.\n\nOption (d): A \"blood clot\" is incorrect terminology and a serious adverse event, not a common side effect. A small amount of bleeding or bruising at the site can occur, but not a clot.\n\nConclusion: Both (a) and (b) are very common. Given that irritability is a direct consequence of the discomfort and immune response, (a) Unusual crying is a very strong candidate for what the parent will observe and should be counseled about.",
    "additional": "Parental Counseling for Post-Vaccination Care:\n\nReassurance: Explain that mild reactions are normal and a sign that the child's immune system is responding to the vaccine.\n\nLocal Site Care: A cool, wet cloth can be applied to the injection site to reduce soreness.

    "explanation": "This question addresses the emergency management of seizures in a neonate (a one-month-old is still in the neonatal period). The first-line and second-line drugs for neonatal seizures differ from those for older children.\n\nPhenobarbital (Phenobarbitone) is the first-line drug of choice for treating neonatal seizures according to most international and pediatric guidelines.\n\nOption (a) provides the correct drug and the standard loading dose, which is 20 mg/kg administered IV (preferred) or IM if IV access is not available. This high initial dose is needed to quickly achieve therapeutic levels in the brain.\n\nOption (b) is incorrect for several reasons. Diazepam is generally considered a second or third-line agent in neonates due to risks of respiratory depression and accumulation of its metabolite. Also, \"4 hourly\" is a maintenance schedule, not an emergency stat dose for an active seizure.\n\nOption (c) is an incorrect, sub-therapeutic loading dose.\n\nOption (d) is an incorrect dose and route. While rectal diazepam is used for emergency seizure management in older children (especially in pre-hospital settings), the dose is typically 0.5 mg/kg, and it's not the first-line choice for neonates in a hospital setting.",
    "additional": "Neonatal Seizure Management:\n\nABC's: Ensure a patent airway, provide oxygen, monitor vital signs.\n\nCheck Glucose: Hypoglycemia is a common and easily reversible cause of neonatal seizures.

It most often occurs with a tracheo-esophageal fistula (TEF), an abnormal connection between the trachea and the esophagus. The most common type is esophageal atresia with a distal TEF.\n\nOption (a) lists the three classic and most significant complications:\n\nPneumonia: Saliva and any attempted feeds pool in the esophageal pouch and are aspirated into the lungs. In the common type, gastric acid can also reflux from the stomach up the fistula into the trachea and lungs, causing a severe chemical pneumonitis. This is the most immediate life-threatening complication.\n\nMalnutrition: The infant cannot feed orally, so they will suffer from dehydration and malnutrition if the condition is not diagnosed and treated promptly.\n\nIntestinal Obstruction: While TEA itself is an esophageal obstruction, about 50% of infants with TEA/TEF have other associated anomalies (VACTERL association), including duodenal atresia, which is a form of intestinal obstruction.\n\nOption (b) and (d): Stenosis and leakage are complications of the surgical repair, not of the initial condition itself.\n\nOption (c): The primary presenting sign is choking and cyanosis with feeds, not constipation. The fistula is part of the primary defect, not a complication. Abdominal distension occurs because air from the trachea passes through the fistula into the stomach.",

Although the total white blood cell count may be very high, these cells are immature and cannot perform their normal immune function of fighting infection. This condition is known as neutropenia (a deficiency of functional neutrophils), even if the overall WBC count is high.\n\nOption (a) is not entirely accurate. The number of white cells can be low, normal, or very high, but the key issue is their lack of function. Option (d) is more precise.\n\nOption (b), Altered skin integrity, is a risk factor for infection (e.g., from frequent IV placements or mucositis), but it is a consequence of the disease and its treatment, not the primary reason for the compromised immune system itself.\n\nOption (c) is incorrect. While stress (releasing catecholamines) can affect the immune system, the primary defect in leukemia is the marrow failure.",
    "additional": "Pathophysiology of Leukemia: The uncontrolled proliferation of lymphoblasts in the bone marrow leads to \"crowding out\" of the normal hematopoietic stem cells. This results in:\n\nNeutropenia: Deficiency of mature, functional neutrophils -> Risk of Infection.\n\nAnemia: Deficiency of red blood cells -> Fatigue, pallor.\n\nThrombocytopenia: Deficiency of platelets -> Risk of Bleeding and Bruising.\n\nInfection as a Medical Emergency: Infection in a neutropenic child (especially a fever, known as febrile neutropenia) is a medical emergency. These children can become septic very quickly from common bacteria.\n\nNursing Care (Infection Prevention):\n\nHand hygiene: The single most important measure.\n\nProtective (Reverse) Isolation: Placing the child in a private room.\n\nScreening: Screen visitors for any signs of illness.\n\nAseptic technique for all invasive procedures.\n\nNo live virus vaccines (e.g., MMR, varicella) should be given to a child on chemotherapy.\n\nAvoid fresh flowers/plants in the room.\n\nProvide meticulous oral and skin care."

      "D": "Temperature of 102°F (38.9° C)"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Excessive IV fluid infusion leads to fluid volume overload (hypervolemia). The question asks for a sign of this condition in a child.\n\nOption (a) is the most direct and serious sign of fluid overload. The excess fluid in the circulatory system increases hydrostatic pressure, forcing fluid out of the pulmonary capillaries and into the interstitial spaces and alveoli of the lungs. This condition is called pulmonary edema. It manifests as dyspnea (difficulty breathing), tachypnea (rapid breathing), and crackles on auscultation.\n\nOption (b), Gastric distension, is not a direct sign of IV fluid overload. It's more related to air swallowing, GI obstruction, or ascites.\n\nOption (c), Nausea and vomiting, can be caused by many things but is not a classic sign of fluid overload.\n\nOption (d), A high temperature (fever), is a sign of infection or an inflammatory process, not fluid overload. In fact, a sign of fluid overload can be a bounding pulse.",
    "additional": "Signs of Fluid Volume Overload in Children:\n\nRespiratory: Dyspnea, tachypnea, orthopnea (difficulty breathing when lying flat), cough, frothy sputum, crackles on lung auscultation.\n\nCardiovascular: Tachycardia, bounding pulse, hypertension, distended neck veins (jugular venous distention - JVD), S3 heart sound (gallop).\n\nGeneral: Sudden weight gain, edema (periorbital edema is common in children), bulging fontanelle in infants.\n\nNursing Responsibilities for IV Therapy in Children:\n\nCalculation and Rate: Always double-check IV fluid calculations. Use an infusion pump for precise delivery.\n\nMonitoring:\n- Assess IV site frequently for signs of infiltration or phlebitis.\n- Monitor intake and output meticulously.\n- Weigh the child daily (the most sensitive indicator of fluid status).\n- Perform regular respiratory and cardiovascular assessments.\n\nFluid Needs: Children have a higher percentage of body water and a higher metabolic rate than adults, making them more vulnerable to both dehydration and fluid overload."

      "C": "Decrease proteinuria",
      "D": "Prevent infection"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The question asks about the primary goal of corticosteroid therapy in nephrotic syndrome.\n\nNephrotic syndrome is a kidney disorder characterized by a group of symptoms: massive proteinuria (protein in the urine), hypoalbuminemia (low protein in the blood), edema, and hyperlipidemia. The underlying problem is damage to the glomeruli, which makes them permeable to large proteins like albumin.\n\nOption (c) is the primary therapeutic goal. Corticosteroids (like prednisolone) are the first-line treatment for the most common type of childhood nephrotic syndrome (Minimal Change Disease). They work by suppressing the immune system and reducing the inflammation that damages the glomerular membrane. This restores the integrity of the glomeruli, which then stops leaking protein into the urine. Decreasing proteinuria is the direct mechanism by which steroids induce remission.\n\nOption (a) is incorrect. Corticosteroids can cause hypertension as a side effect, but that is not their therapeutic purpose.\n\nOption (b), Reducing inflammation, is how the corticosteroids work, but the purpose or desired outcome is the reduction of proteinuria. Option (c) is the more specific and primary clinical goal.\n\nOption (d) is the opposite of what steroids do. They suppress the immune system, which actually increases the risk of infection. This is a major side effect that nurses must monitor for.",

    "explanation": "This question tests the understanding of acid-base imbalances caused by loss of gastric contents.\n\nThe stomach secretes large amounts of hydrochloric acid (HCl).\n\nWhen an infant has uncontrolled vomiting, they lose significant amounts of this stomach acid.\n\nThe loss of acid (H⁺ ions) from the body leads to a relative excess of bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻), causing the blood pH to rise. This condition is metabolic alkalosis.\n\nOption (c) is the correct answer.\n\nOption (b), Acidosis, would result from the loss of base. This typically occurs with diarrhea, where large amounts of bicarbonate-rich intestinal fluid are lost.\n\nOption (a), Tetany (muscle spasms, cramps), is a sign of hypocalcemia, which can be caused by severe alkalosis, but alkalosis is the primary imbalance.\n\nOption (d), Hypersensitivity, is an allergic reaction and is unrelated.",

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This question asks you to identify a set of high-priority signs in a pediatric emergency, likely referencing a triage system like the Emergency Triage Assessment and Treatment (ETAT) guidelines used by the WHO. ETAT focuses on quickly identifying children with life-threatening conditions.\n\nThe ETAT Priority Signs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Coma, Convulsion, Severe Dehydration - ABCDS):\n\n- Obstructed or absent breathing\n- Severe respiratory distress\n- Central cyanosis\n- Signs of shock (cold hands with slow capillary refill, weak fast pulse)\n- Coma or lethargy\n- Convulsing now\n- Severe dehydration in a child with diarrhea\n\nLet's analyze the options based on these universal priorities:\n\nOption (d) contains two absolute top-priority signs: severe respiratory distress (a \"Breathing\" emergency) and coma (a \"Coma\" emergency). Pyrexia (fever) is a common sign but becomes a priority when associated with these other signs. This is the strongest set of priority indicators.\n\nOption (a): Coma is a priority sign. Restlessness can be a sign of hypoxia but is less specific than severe distress. Poisoning is a cause or presentation, not a sign itself.\n\nOption (b): These are important findings but are not typically classified as the highest-level, immediate life-threatening priority signs in initial triage compared to airway, breathing, and consciousness issues.\n\nOption (c): Convulsion and central cyanosis are priority signs. Poisoning is a presentation. This is also a strong option, but severe respiratory distress in option (d) is an immediate threat to life that encompasses cyanosis.",

      "D": "Occurs due to rays of light being focused behind the retina"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This question defines hyperopia, also known as farsightedness or long-sightedness.\n\nOption (d) is the correct definition. In hyperopia, the eye's focusing system is too weak for its length, or the eyeball itself is too short. As a result, when looking at a nearby object, the light rays converge at a focal point behind the retina, causing the image on the retina to be blurry. Distant objects may be seen more clearly.\n\nOption (a) and (c) describe astigmatism, a condition where the cornea or lens has an irregular, non-spherical curvature, causing light to be focused at multiple points, resulting in blurry vision at all distances.\n\nOption (b) describes myopia, or nearsightedness. In myopia, the eyeball is too long, or the focusing system is too strong, causing light from distant objects to be focused in front of the retina.",
    "additional": "Refractive Errors Summary:\n| Condition | Common Name | What it is | Where light focuses | Corrected with... |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Hyperopia | Farsightedness | Eyeball too short | Behind the retina | Convex lens (converging) |\n| Myopia | Nearsightedness | Eyeball too long | In front of the retina | Concave lens (diverging) |\n| Astigmatism| - | Irregular cornea/lens | Multiple points | Cylindrical lens |\n\nHyperopia in Children: A mild degree of hyperopia is normal in young children and usually self-corrects as the eyeball grows longer. However, significant hyperopia can cause esotropia (inward turning of the eye, a type of strabismus) and amblyopia (\"lazy eye\"), where the brain starts to ignore the blurry image from one eye, leading to poor vision development in that eye. This is why vision screening in children is crucial."

      "C": "Decreased albumin in blood",
      "D": "Renal failure"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This question asks for the primary mechanism causing the characteristic severe edema in nephrotic syndrome.\n\nThe pathophysiology of nephrotic syndrome begins with damage to the glomeruli, which leads to massive proteinuria (loss of protein, mainly albumin, in the urine).\n\nThis loss of protein from the blood results in hypoalbuminemia (low levels of albumin in the blood).\n\nAlbumin is the main protein responsible for maintaining plasma colloid osmotic pressure (or oncotic pressure). This is the \"pulling\" force that holds fluid inside the blood vessels.\n\nOption (c) is correct. When blood albumin levels fall drastically, the plasma colloid osmotic pressure decreases. This reduces the force holding fluid within the capillaries, allowing fluid to shift out into the interstitial spaces, causing severe, generalized edema (anasarca).\n\nOption (a), Dilatation of blood capillaries, is not the primary cause.\n\nOption (b), Inflammatory processes, are the root cause of the glomerular damage, but the direct cause of the edema is the resulting hypoalbuminemia.\n\nOption (d), Renal failure, is a state of poor kidney function. While nephrotic syndrome can progress to renal failure, the edema in classic nephrotic syndrome is primarily driven by protein loss, not the kidney's inability to excrete water (as seen in acute renal failure).",
    "additional": "Starling's Forces: This concept governs fluid movement across capillaries. Edema occurs when the balance is disrupted.\n\nForces Pushing Fluid OUT: Capillary Hydrostatic Pressure (blood pressure) and Interstitial Oncotic Pressure.\n\nForces Pulling Fluid IN: Capillary Oncotic Pressure (albumin) and Interstitial Hydrostatic Pressure.\n\nIn nephrotic syndrome, the Capillary Oncotic Pressure is dramatically reduced, leading to a net movement of fluid out of the vessels.\n\nClinical Features of Nephrotic Edema: The edema is typically soft, pitting, and gravity-dependent, but it characteristically appears first in areas with low tissue tension, such as around the eyes (periorbital edema), which is often most noticeable in the morning. It can also lead to ascites (fluid in the abdomen) and pleural effusions."

      "D": "Nursing the child in isolation, catheterisation to monitor urine output"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This question asks for appropriate nursing interventions for an immunosuppressed school-age child. Immunosuppression can be caused by diseases like leukemia (ALL) or by medications like corticosteroids or chemotherapy. The primary nursing goal is to prevent infection while also promoting normal growth and development.\n\nOption (c) is the best answer as it balances both infection control and psychosocial needs.\n\nNursing the child in isolation: This refers to protective (or reverse) isolation, where measures are taken to protect the patient from pathogens in the environment. This includes a private room, strict hand hygiene, and screening visitors. This is a critical infection control measure.\n\nEncouraging child to perform at optimal level: This addresses the holistic and developmental needs of the child. A 9-year-old is in the school-age period (Erikson's stage of Industry vs. Inferiority). It is crucial to encourage normal activities as much as possible, such as schoolwork, hobbies, and play, to foster a sense of accomplishment and normalcy and prevent feelings of inferiority.\n\nOption (a) and (d): Catheterization is an invasive procedure that carries a high risk of introducing infection (Catheter-Associated UTI). It should be strictly avoided in an immunosuppressed child unless absolutely necessary. There are less invasive ways to monitor urine output (e.g., weighing diapers, using a urinal, daily weights).\n\nOption (b): Offering fresh fruits and vegetables is contraindicated. The skins of raw fruits and vegetables can harbor bacteria and fungi (like Pseudomonas). Immunosuppressed patients are typically placed on a neutropenic (or low-microbial) diet, which requires all foods to be thoroughly cooked. Therefore, this option is dangerous.",
    "additional": "Infection Control in the Immunosuppressed Child:\n\nHand Hygiene: The number one priority.\n\nEnvironment: Private room, positive pressure airflow if available. No fresh flowers/plants.\n\nDiet: Low-microbial diet (no raw fruits/veg, no unpasteurized dairy, no deli meats).\n\nVisitors: Screen for illness, limit visitors.\n\nProcedures: Strict aseptic technique for all invasive lines (e.g., central lines).\n\nVaccines: No live virus vaccines (MMR, Varicella, Rotavirus, nasal flu vaccine).\n\nMonitoring: Monitor closely for the earliest signs of infection. Remember that classic signs like high fever and pus formation may be absent because the child cannot mount a normal inflammatory response. A low-grade fever can be a sign of a serious infection.\n\nPsychosocial Care:\n\nProvide age-appropriate explanations to the child and family.\n\nEncourage expression of feelings.\n\nMaintain routines and connections with school and peers as much as possible (e.g., through online classes, safe visits from healthy friends)."
