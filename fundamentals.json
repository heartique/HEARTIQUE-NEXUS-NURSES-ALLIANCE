    "question": "When monitoring for infection in an elderly client, a nurse would expect",
    "options": {
      "A": "More severe signs of infection.",
      "B": "Shaking, chills but no fever.",
      "C": "Changes in mental status.",
      "D": "Fever, shivering and restlessness"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The immune response in older adults is often blunted. They may not mount a classic febrile (fever) response or have a significantly elevated white blood cell count. One of the earliest and most common signs of an underlying infection (like a UTI or pneumonia) in an elderly person is a change in their baseline mental status. This can manifest as new-onset or worsening confusion, delirium, agitation, or lethargy.\n\nWhile other signs can occur, they are less reliable than a mental status change. Fever, shivering, and severe signs are part of the classic inflammatory response, which is often diminished in the elderly. Relying on them can lead to a missed or delayed diagnosis.\n\nAtypical Presentation of Illness in the Elderly: Understanding that elderly patients may present with non-specific symptoms for serious conditions (e.g., confusion for infection, silent MI, weakness for dehydration).\n\nDelirium vs. Dementia:\n- Delirium: Acute onset, fluctuating course, caused by an underlying medical condition (like infection, medication, or electrolyte imbalance), and is often reversible.\n- Dementia: Gradual onset, progressive, chronic, and generally irreversible.\n\nCommon Infections in the Elderly: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) and pneumonia are leading causes of morbidity and mortality."

    "question": "The appropriate nursing intervention for a client with a diagnosis of ineffective airway clearance is:-",
    "options": {
      "A": "Withholding pain medication.",
      "B": "Administering cough suppressants every 4-6 hours.",
      "C": "Administering antibiotics as prescribed.",
      "D": "Maintaining adequate hydration and providing increased humidity."
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The nursing diagnosis 'Ineffective Airway Clearance' means the client is unable to clear secretions or obstructions from the respiratory tract to maintain a clear airway. The most effective non-invasive nursing intervention to address this is to thin the secretions so they are easier to cough up and expectorate. Adequate hydration (e.g., encouraging oral fluids) and humidification of inspired air are the primary ways to achieve this.\n\nWithholding pain medication: Inadequate pain control can lead to shallow breathing and a weak cough, which would worsen airway clearance.\n\nAdministering cough suppressants (antitussives): This is contraindicated. The goal is to facilitate a productive cough to clear the airway, not suppress it.\n\nAdministering antibiotics: This treats the underlying infection (if present) but does not directly address the mechanical problem of clearing existing secretions from the airway. It is a medical intervention, not an independent nursing action focused on the diagnosis itself.\n\nOther Interventions for Airway Clearance:\n- Positioning: High-Fowler's or semi-Fowler's position to facilitate lung expansion.\n- Coughing and Deep Breathing Exercises: Encouraging the client to turn, cough, and deep breathe (TCDB).\n- Chest Physiotherapy (CPT): Percussion and vibration to loosen secretions.\n- Suctioning: Oropharyngeal or nasotracheal suctioning if the client is unable to cough effectively."

    "question": "The care of a patient with a pressure ulcer includes:-",
    "options": {
      "A": "Providing a cardiac bed.",
      "B": "Massaging reddened areas of patient's skin.",
      "C": "Use of a puff sheet when moving client up in bed.",
      "D": "Having the patient sit on a doughnut type of device."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "A major cause of pressure injuries is shearing force, which occurs when skin layers slide over one another, stretching and damaging blood vessels. This often happens when a patient slides down in bed. Using a lift or 'puff' sheet with two caregivers to lift and reposition the patient, rather than pulling or dragging them, is a critical intervention to prevent shear and friction.\n\nProviding a cardiac bed: A cardiac bed is a chair-like position used for patients with heart failure to ease breathing; it is not a primary intervention for pressure ulcers.\n\nMassaging reddened areas: This is an outdated and harmful practice. Massaging a non-blanchable reddened area (a Stage 1 pressure injury) can further damage the fragile underlying capillaries and tissue.\n\nUsing a doughnut device: These are contraindicated. Doughnut-type devices can actually cause pressure injuries by creating a circle of pressure that impairs circulation to the tissue inside the ring.\n\nRisk Factors for Pressure Injuries: Immobility, impaired sensation, poor nutrition, moisture (incontinence), and shear/friction.\n\nBraden Scale: A tool used to assess a patient's risk for developing pressure injuries.\n\nStaging of Pressure Injuries:\n- Stage 1: Non-blanchable erythema of intact skin.\n- Stage 2: Partial-thickness skin loss with exposed dermis.\n- Stage 3: Full-thickness skin loss (fat visible).\n- Stage 4: Full-thickness skin and tissue loss (muscle, bone, or tendon visible).\n- Unstageable: Obscured full-thickness loss (covered by slough or eschar).\n- Deep Tissue Injury (DTI): Persistent, non-blanchable deep red, maroon, or purple discoloration.\n\nPressure-Relieving Surfaces: Specialty mattresses and bed overlays.\n\nNutritional Support: Ensuring adequate protein, calories, and hydration to promote wound healing."

    "question": "Following surgery for a perforated appendix with localized peritonitis, the nurse should place the patient in",
    "options": {
      "A": "Trendelenburg position",
      "B": "Dorsal recumbent position",
      "C": "Sim's position",
      "D": "Semi-Fowler's position"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Peritonitis is the inflammation of the peritoneum, the membrane lining the abdominal cavity. After surgery for a perforated appendix, there is infectious fluid (pus) within the abdomen. Placing the patient in a Semi-Fowler's position (head of the bed elevated 30–45 degrees) utilizes gravity to help localize the drainage of this purulent material into the lower abdomen (pelvis). This helps prevent the fluid from spreading upwards towards the diaphragm, where it could cause a subphrenic abscess and respiratory complications. It also promotes easier breathing and reduces tension on the abdominal incision.\n\nTrendelenburg position would cause fluid to move upward toward the diaphragm — contraindicated. Dorsal recumbent allows fluid to spread freely. Sim's position does not assist in isolating intra-abdominal fluid.",
    "additional": "Signs of Peritonitis: Rebound tenderness, board-like abdominal rigidity, fever, tachycardia, and paralytic ileus.\n\nPost-operative Care for Peritonitis:\n- NG Tube: Often placed to decompress the stomach.\n- IV Fluids and Antibiotics: To manage dehydration and sepsis.\n- Wound Care: Monitoring for infection and promoting healing.\n- Pain Management: Encourages mobility and deep breathing."

    "question": "Following spinal cord injury, the patient is encouraged to take fluids mainly to prevent:-",
    "options": {
      "A": "Urinary tract infection",
      "B": "Dehydration",
      "C": "Skin breakdown",
      "D": "Fluid and electrolyte imbalance"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "While high fluid intake helps with hydration and skin health, the most direct and primary reason in spinal cord injury (SCI) patients is to prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs). SCI often results in neurogenic bladder, leading to urinary retention and catheterization — both increase the risk of UTIs. Fluids help flush the bladder and dilute urine, reducing bacterial colonization.\n\nDehydration and electrolyte imbalance are general benefits of fluid intake, but not the focused priority. Skin breakdown prevention focuses more on mobility and pressure relief.",
    "additional": "Types of Neurogenic Bladder: Spastic (reflex) vs. Flaccid (atonic).\n\nBladder Management: Intermittent catheterization, indwelling catheters, Crede's maneuver.\n\nSpinal Shock: Temporary flaccid paralysis, hypotension, bradycardia.\n\nAutonomic Dysreflexia (for injuries above T6): Severe headache, hypertension, bradycardia — triggered by bladder distention, fecal impaction, tight clothes.\nNursing action: Sit patient up and eliminate the trigger."

    "question": "When performing postural drainage for the lower lobes of lung, the nurse positions the patient in:-",
    "options": {
      "A": "Sitting up/Fowler's position..",
      "B": "Reverse Trendelenberg position.",
      "C": "Dorsal position with a pillow supporting the waist.",
      "D": "Lateral position with the head elevated at 30 to 45 degrees"
    },
    "answer": "None",
    "explanation": "None of the provided answers are correct. The goal of postural drainage is to use gravity to assist drainage of secretions from specific lung segments. For the lower lobes, this requires the head to be lower than the chest — achieved through Trendelenburg position. None of the listed options place the patient in proper position for lower lobe drainage.\n\nSitting up/Fowler's position drains upper lobes. Reverse Trendelenburg is opposite to what’s needed. Dorsal and lateral head-elevated positions also do not facilitate lower lobe drainage.",
    "additional": "Correct Positioning for Lower Lobes: Trendelenburg position with patient prone, supine, or lateral based on segment targeted.\n\nOther Lobe Positions:\n- Upper Lobes (Apical): Sitting upright.\n- Upper Lobes (Anterior): Supine.\n- Upper Lobes (Posterior): Sitting leaning forward.\n\nChest Physiotherapy:\n- Combine with percussion and vibration.\n- Best before meals or 1–2 hours after.\n\nContraindications: Increased ICP, unstable cardiac status, recent surgery."

      "A": "Homan's sign",
      "B": "Kernig's sign",
      "C": "Hegar's sign",
      "D": "Brudzinski's sign"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Thrombophlebitis refers to inflammation of a vein with associated thrombus formation. Homan’s sign — pain in the calf on dorsiflexion of the foot — was historically used to identify deep vein thrombosis (DVT). While commonly taught, it is no longer a reliable or recommended diagnostic tool due to low sensitivity and specificity.\n\nKernig’s and Brudzinski’s signs are used in diagnosing meningitis. Hegar’s sign indicates early pregnancy (softening of the uterus).",
    "additional": "Homan’s Sign Limitations: Not reliable, not recommended for modern practice.\n\nVirchow’s Triad (DVT risk factors):\n- Stasis\n- Endothelial injury\n- Hypercoagulability\n\nSigns of DVT: Unilateral leg swelling, redness, pain, and warmth.\n\nDiagnostic Gold Standard: Doppler ultrasound.\n\nDVT Complication: Pulmonary embolism (PE).\n\nPrevention: Early ambulation, compression stockings, anticoagulants (e.g., heparin)."

    "question": "To evaluate a patient's apical heart rate, the nurse places the stethoscope on:-",
    "options": {
      "A": "Right side at midclavicular line, fourth intercostal space",
      "B": "Left side at midclavicular line, fifth intercostal space",
      "C": "The sternum directly over the heart",
      "D": "Left side at midclavicular line, between 3rd and 4th intercostal space"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The apical pulse is best heard at the point of maximal impulse (PMI), located at the 5th intercostal space along the left midclavicular line. This is where the contraction of the left ventricle is most prominent. It is the most accurate location for assessing heart rate and rhythm, particularly when there are irregularities or the patient is on cardiac medications.\n\nOther positions listed do not correspond to the correct anatomical location of the apical impulse and may result in inaccurate assessments.",
    "additional": "When to take an Apical Pulse: In cases of irregular rhythms, suspected pulse deficit, or while administering cardiac meds (e.g., digoxin).\n\nPulse Deficit: Difference between apical and radial pulse rates; may indicate atrial fibrillation or premature beats.\n\nAuscultation Sites (Mnemonic: APE To Man):\n- Aortic: 2nd ICS, right sternal border\n- Pulmonic: 2nd ICS, left sternal border\n- Erb's Point: 3rd ICS, left sternal border\n- Tricuspid: 4th ICS, left sternal border\n- Mitral (Apical): 5th ICS, left MCL"

      "C": "Distance at which the patient is from the chart",
      "D": "Distance at which the patient is from the chart"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "In a Snellen visual acuity score (e.g., 20/40), the denominator represents the distance at which a person with normal vision could read the line of letters the patient can read. So, 20/40 means the patient can see at 20 feet what a person with normal vision can see at 40 feet.\n\nWhile the options in this question are poorly worded and two are duplicates, option A is the closest in intent.",
    "additional": "Snellen Test Procedure: Patient stands 20 feet away, covers one eye, and reads the smallest visible line.\n\nVisual Impairments:\n- Myopia: Nearsightedness (difficulty seeing distant objects).\n- Hyperopia: Farsightedness (difficulty seeing near objects).\n- Presbyopia: Age-related farsightedness.\n\nLegal Blindness: 20/200 or worse with corrective lenses or a visual field of 20 degrees or less."

      "D": "Hypothyroidism"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Substance abuse can significantly impact surgical outcomes.

      "C": "The day after dialysis",
      "D": "Upon return from dialysis"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Enalapril, an antihypertensive ACE inhibitor, can potentiate hypotension when combined with the fluid shifts of hemodialysis. Administering it after dialysis ensures the patient's blood pressure is stable and the medication is not removed during the session. This timing helps avoid dangerous drops in BP.",
    "additional": "Hold antihypertensives before dialysis unless ordered otherwise.\n\nPost-Dialysis Priorities:\n- Monitor vital signs (especially hypotension).\n- Assess AV access for bleeding or infection.\n- Evaluate for disequilibrium syndrome.\n- Compare pre- and post-weight to assess fluid removal."

      "C": "Allow underlying viable tissues to expand.",
      "D": "Reduce pain."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "A full-thickness burn creates a tough, leathery, non-elastic layer of dead tissue called eschar. When this eschar is circumferential, it acts like a tourniquet. As the underlying tissue swells, the eschar constricts it, cutting off blood flow or restricting breathing. An escharotomy is a surgical incision made through the eschar to relieve this pressure and allow the tissues to expand.",
    "additional": "A: While restoring blood flow will improve oxygenation, the direct aim is expansion.\nB: Escharotomy is an incision, not the removal of eschar. Debridement is the removal of dead tissue.\nD: Full-thickness burns destroy nerves, so the area may be painless. The goal is to save tissue, not pain relief.\n\nRule of Nines: Quick TBSA estimation method.\nPhases of Burn Management: Emergent/Resuscitative, Acute, Rehabilitative.\nFluid Resuscitation: Parkland Formula = 4 mL × kg × %TBSA.\nCompartment Syndrome: Prevented by escharotomy.

      "D": "Use a 50cc syringe to push the lavage solution into the stomach."
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "During gastric lavage, the safest position is the left lateral with the head down (Trendelenburg). This positioning helps pool fluid in the greater curvature of the stomach, reducing the risk of pushing toxins into the small intestine. It also minimizes the risk of aspiration in case the patient vomits.",

      "B": "Red hard skin",
      "C": "Warm tender skin",
      "D": "Purulent drainage"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Serous drainage is a normal finding in the early stages of wound healing. It is clear, watery, and pale yellow fluid, indicating the inflammatory response is progressing normally. The incision site should also have well-approximated edges with minimal surrounding redness.",
    "additional": "Why B, C, and D are incorrect:\n- B: Red, hard skin (induration and significant erythema) can indicate infection.\n- C: Warmth and tenderness around the site are signs of infection.\n- D: Purulent drainage (thick yellow, green, or tan fluid) is a definitive sign of infection.\n\nTypes of Wound Drainage:\n- Serous: Clear, watery fluid (normal).\n- Sanguineous: Bright red, indicates bleeding.\n- Serosanguineous: Pale red, watery mixture of blood and serum.\n- Purulent: Thick, opaque, and indicates infection.\n\nSigns of Wound Infection (REEDA Mnemonic):\n- Redness\n- Edema\n- Ecchymosis\n- Drainage\n- Approximation (poor edge closure suggests infection)\n\nComplications:\n- Dehiscence: Separation of wound edges.\n- Evisceration: Protrusion of internal organs. Requires immediate action—cover with sterile, saline-soaked dressing and notify the surgical team."

    "question": "Proper care of feet for a patient who has diabetes mellitus includes:",
    "options": {
      "A": "Not soaking feet.",
      "B": "Applying moisturizing lotion to feet and between toes.",
      "C": "Always seeking a podiatrist to cut toe",
      "D": "Avoiding washing feet with soap"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Soaking the feet can dry out the skin by stripping it of its natural oils. Dry skin is more prone to cracking, which can create a portal of entry for infection. Additionally, for a patient with diabetic neuropathy, prolonged soaking can lead to maceration (softening and breakdown of the skin), increasing infection risk. Therefore, diabetics should wash their feet daily with soap and warm water but should not soak them.",
    "additional": "Why B, C, and D are incorrect:\nB: Applying moisturizing lotion is correct, but it should not be applied between the toes. Moisture trapped between the toes can promote the growth of fungus.\nC: While seeing a podiatrist for nail care is the safest option, the word \"always\" makes this a very strict statement. The standard teaching is that patients should cut their toenails straight across and file the edges, but if they have poor vision, thick nails, or neuropathy, they must see a podiatrist. A is a more universally applicable rule.\nD: Feet should be washed daily with a mild soap and warm water.\n\nAdditional Possible Content to be Tested Next:\n- Inspect feet daily for any cuts, blisters, redness, or swelling.\n- Wash feet daily with mild soap and warm water; test water temperature with elbow first.\n- Dry feet thoroughly, especially between the toes.\n- Wear clean, soft socks (cotton or wool).\n- Wear well-fitting, supportive shoes; never go barefoot.\n- Break in new shoes slowly.\n- Pathophysiology of Diabetic Foot Ulcers: A combination of neuropathy (loss of protective sensation), peripheral artery disease (impaired blood flow and healing), and immunodeficiency (impaired ability to fight infection)."

    "question": "The most appropriate position to place a patient who has undergone supratentorial craniotomy is:",
    "options": {
      "A": "Sidelying",
      "B": "Supine",
      "C": "Semi-fowler's",
      "D": "Dorsal recumbent"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "A supratentorial craniotomy is surgery performed on the cerebrum, above the tentorium cerebelli. After this surgery, a primary goal is to prevent or manage increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Placing the patient in a Semi-Fowler's position, with the head of the bed elevated 30-45 degrees, is crucial. This position promotes venous drainage from the head via the jugular veins, thereby helping to lower ICP. The head should also be kept in a neutral, midline position to avoid kinking the jugular veins.",
    "additional": "Why A, B, and D are incorrect:\nLying flat (supine or dorsal recumbent) or on the side without head elevation would impede venous drainage and could increase ICP.\n\nAdditional Possible Content to be Tested Next:\n- Positioning for Infratentorial Craniotomy: After surgery on the cerebellum or brainstem, the patient is often kept flat or with only slight elevation (10-15 degrees), and neck flexion should be avoided.\n- Signs of Increased ICP:\n  - Early: Change in LOC, headache, pupillary changes.\n  - Late (Cushing's Triad): Bradycardia, widened pulse pressure, irregular respirations.\n- Other Nursing Interventions: Maintain quiet environment, space out activities, avoid Valsalva maneuvers, maintain normothermia."

    "question": "The major mechanism involved in neurogenic shock is:",
    "options": {
      "A": "Allergic reaction",
      "B": "Cardiac pump failure",
      "C": "Vasodilation",
      "D": "Septicemia"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Neurogenic shock is a type of distributive shock that results from a loss or disruption of sympathetic nervous system tone, most commonly due to a spinal cord injury at T6 or above. The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for maintaining vascular tone. When this tone is lost, it leads to massive, widespread vasodilation. The blood vessels become 'too big' for the volume of blood, causing a relative hypovolemia. This results in a dramatic drop in blood pressure and pooling of blood in the peripheral vessels.",
    "additional": "Why A, B, and D are incorrect:\nA: An allergic reaction causes anaphylactic shock.\nB: Cardiac pump failure causes cardiogenic shock.\nD: Septicemia causes septic shock.\n\nAdditional Possible Content to be Tested Next:\n- Classic Signs: Hypotension and bradycardia (a key distinguishing feature from other shock types).\n- In other forms of shock, tachycardia is a compensatory response. In neurogenic shock, sympathetic innervation to the heart is lost.\n- Skin may initially be warm and dry due to peripheral vasodilation.\n- Treatment: Use vasopressors (e.g., norepinephrine), atropine for bradycardia, and cautious fluid administration."

      "C": "Remove any obstacles from the client's path of ambulation.",
      "D": "Provide semisolid food"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Cranial Nerve II is the Optic Nerve, which is responsible for the sense of vision. Impairment of this nerve leads to partial or complete vision loss. The most important safety measure for a visually impaired client is to maintain a safe, predictable environment and prevent falls or injuries. Removing obstacles like throw rugs, furniture, and clutter from walking paths is a critical intervention.",
    "additional": "Why A, B, and D are incorrect:\nA: This is appropriate for clients with impaired sensation (e.g., peripheral neuropathy).\nB: This is appropriate for hearing impairment (Cranial Nerve VIII - Vestibulocochlear).\nD: This is for dysphagia (swallowing issues) related to CN IX, X, or XII.\n\nAdditional Possible Content to be Tested Next:\nKnow the 12 Cranial Nerves and Functions (Mnemonic: Oh Oh Oh To Touch And Feel Very Good Velvet, Such Heaven):\nI: Olfactory (Smell)\nII: Optic (Vision)\nIII: Oculomotor (Eye movement, pupil constriction)\nIV: Trochlear (Eye movement)\nV: Trigeminal (Facial sensation, chewing)\nVI: Abducens (Eye movement)\nVII: Facial (Facial expression, taste)\nVIII: Vestibulocochlear (Hearing, balance)\nIX: Glossopharyngeal (Swallowing, taste, gag reflex)\nX: Vagus (Swallowing, speaking, parasympathetic control)\nXI: Accessory (Shoulder shrug, head turning)\nXII: Hypoglossal (Tongue movement)"

      "B": "Barky",
      "C": "Muffled",
      "D": "Wheezy"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Laryngotracheobronchitis, commonly known as croup, is a viral infection of the upper airway that causes inflammation and swelling in the larynx (voice box) and trachea (windpipe). This narrowing of the subglottic airway (the area just below the vocal cords) results in the classic, hallmark sign of a hoarse, \"barking seal\" cough. This is often accompanied by inspiratory stridor (a high-pitched sound on inhalation).",
    "additional": "Why A, C, and D are incorrect:\nA. Moist: A moist or productive cough suggests inflammation and fluid in the lower airways, as seen in pneumonia or bronchitis.\nC. Muffled: A muffled, \"hot potato\" voice is a classic sign of epiglottitis, a bacterial infection of the epiglottis which is a different and more life-threatening condition.\nD. Wheezy: Wheezing is a high-pitched whistling sound on exhalation, caused by narrowing of the lower airways (bronchioles), and is the hallmark of asthma or bronchiolitis.\n\nAdditional Possible Content to be Tested Next:\nCroup vs. Epiglottitis:\n- Croup: Viral, slow onset, low-grade fever, barking cough, hoarse voice, no drooling.\n- Epiglottitis: Bacterial (HiB), rapid onset, high fever, muffled voice, drooling, and tripod positioning. Epiglottitis is a medical emergency.\n\nNursing Management of Croup:\n- Maintain a calm environment (crying worsens airway obstruction).\n- Administer cool, humidified air.\n- Administer medications as ordered: nebulized epinephrine (to reduce swelling) and oral or IM corticosteroids (to reduce inflammation)."

    "question": "A client with a spinal cord injury is at risk of developing footdrop. The nurse should use which of the following as the effective preventative measure?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Foot board",
      "B": "Heel protectors",
      "C": "Posterior splints",
      "D": "Pneumatic boots"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Foot drop is the inability to lift the front part of the foot (dorsiflexion) due to weakness or paralysis of the muscles. In an immobile patient, the foot naturally falls into plantar flexion (toes pointing down). If left in this position, the Achilles tendon can shorten and a contracture can develop, making the foot drop permanent. A foot board, high-top sneakers, or padded splints are used to keep the foot in a neutral, dorsiflexed position, preventing this contracture.",
    "additional": "Why B, C, and D are incorrect:\nB. Heel protectors: These are used to \"float\" the heels off the mattress to prevent pressure injuries on the heel, but they do not prevent foot drop.\nC. Posterior splints: While a type of splint can be used, \"foot board\" is the classic and most direct answer for this specific problem.\nD. Pneumatic boots (SCDs): Sequential compression devices are used to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT), not foot drop.\n\nAdditional Possible Content to be Tested Next:\nContractures: The shortening and hardening of muscles, tendons, or other tissue, often leading to deformity and rigidity of joints.\n\nNursing Interventions to Prevent Contractures:\n- Performing active and passive range-of-motion (ROM) exercises.\n- Proper positioning and use of splints or supportive devices.\n- Encouraging mobility as much as possible.\n\nOther Complications of Immobility: Pressure injuries, DVT, pneumonia, constipation, and muscle atrophy."

    "question": "A client begins to experience a tonic clonic seizure. The nurse should take which of the following actions except?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Restrain the client",
      "B": "Turn the client to the side",
      "C": "Maintain the client's airway",
      "D": "Loosen any restrictive clothing that the client is wearing"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "You should NEVER restrain a client during a seizure. The muscle contractions during a tonic-clonic seizure are extremely powerful. Attempting to restrain the client's movements can lead to musculoskeletal injuries, such as fractures or dislocations, for the patient, and can also cause injury to the nurse.",
    "additional": "Why B, C, and D are incorrect (because they are correct actions to take):\nB & C: The priority during a seizure is patient safety and maintaining a patent airway. Turning the client to the side (recovery position) helps prevent the tongue from occluding the airway and allows saliva or vomit to drain out of the mouth, reducing the risk of aspiration.\nD. Loosen any restrictive clothing: Loosening clothing around the neck (like a tie or tight collar) helps to ensure it does not interfere with breathing.\n\nAdditional Possible Content to be Tested Next:\nSeizure Precautions:\n- For a patient at high risk for seizures, the nurse should have oxygen and suction equipment ready at the bedside and ensure the bed has padded side rails.\n\nObservation and Documentation During a Seizure:\n- Time of onset and duration.\n- Description of movements (e.g., unilateral vs. bilateral, tonic vs. clonic).\n- Any incontinence.\n- Patient's condition after the seizure (post-ictal state)."

      "A": "Measure urine output on an hourly basis",
      "B": "Measure intravenous and oral fluid intake",
      "C": "Elevate the client's head to at least 45 degrees",
      "D": "Administer oxygen at 4L per minute by nasal cannula"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Fluid overload can lead to pulmonary edema, causing shortness of breath. The immediate priority is to improve the patient's oxygenation. Elevating the head of the bed to 45 degrees uses gravity to shift fluid to the lung bases. This increases gas exchange surface area and improves breathing.",
    "additional": "Why A, B, and D are incorrect:\n- A & B: Measuring input/output is important for long-term monitoring but not for immediate relief.\n- D: Oxygen is appropriate but requires an order and does not relieve mechanical fluid overload as quickly as positioning.\n\nAdditional Content:\n- Signs of hypervolemia: JVD, crackles, edema, weight gain.\n- Lab: Low hematocrit, BUN, serum osmolality (hemodilution).\n- Treatment: Diuretics, sodium/fluid restriction.\n- Nursing: Daily weights, respiratory checks, skin care."

      "C": "5% Dextrose",
      "D": "5% Dextrose in normal saline."
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Spinal shock involves hypotension due to vasodilation. The goal is to expand blood volume. Normal saline is isotonic and remains in the vasculature, making it ideal for initial resuscitation. It helps restore BP and perfusion quickly.",
    "additional": "Why A, C, and D are incorrect:\n- A: Dextran is a colloid, but crystalloids like NS are first-line for shock.\n- C: D5W turns into free water and doesn’t stay intravascular.\n- D: D5NS is hypertonic and not used for first-line resuscitation.\n\nAdditional Content:\n- Fluids: Isotonic (NS, LR), Hypotonic (0.45% NS), Hypertonic (3% Saline, D5NS).\n- Spinal vs. Neurogenic Shock: Spinal is neurologic loss; neurogenic is hemodynamic collapse (hypotension, bradycardia)."

      "C": "Wet sterile saline dressings",
      "D": "Half strength Betadine dressings"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Fasciotomy wounds are left open to relieve pressure and promote healing. Wet-to-moist saline dressings keep the site clean and moist, support granulation, and allow gentle debridement. This prevents tissue damage and promotes healing.",
    "additional": "Why A, B, and D are incorrect:\n- A: Dry dressings stick and disrupt healing tissue.\n- B: Hydrocolloids are for clean wounds with minimal drainage.\n- D: Betadine is cytotoxic and impairs granulation tissue.\n\nAdditional Content:\n- Compartment Syndrome Causes: Burns, crush injuries.\n- 6 Ps: Pain, Pallor, Pulselessness, Paresthesia, Paralysis, Poikilothermia.\n- Wound Care: Match dressing to wound status (necrotic vs. granulating).\n- Debridement types: Surgical, mechanical, enzymatic, autolytic."

      "C": "Red blood cells",
      "D": "White blood cells"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Normal CSF is clear, colorless, and mostly acellular. Red blood cells are not normally present. Their presence suggests either bleeding (e.g., subarachnoid hemorrhage) or a traumatic tap during the procedure. Protein, glucose, and few WBCs are normal.",
    "additional": "Additional Content:\n- Post-LP Care: Lie flat to prevent headache, encourage fluids, observe site.\n- CSF Findings:\n  - Bacterial Meningitis: Cloudy, high protein, low glucose, high neutrophils.\n  - Viral Meningitis: Clear, normal glucose, high lymphocytes.\n- A traumatic tap is the most common cause of RBCs in CSF after LP."
