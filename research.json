  {
    "question": "Test-retest reliability in research involves:",
    "options": {
      "A": "Two different measurements taken by different observers and then comparing them",
      "B": "Taking two sets of measurements of the same thing some time apart and comparing them",
      "C": "Recruiting participants randomly to the study project",
      "D": "Subjecting one study group to treatment and the other to placebo"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Test-retest checks stability by comparing repeated measures over time.",
    "additional": "High correlation between time points = high test-retest reliability."

  {
    "question": "Which classification of research designs is based on control over independent variables?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Structured and flexible",
      "B": "Cross-sectional and longitudinal",
      "C": "Retrospective and prospective",
      "D": "Experimental/quasi-experimental and non-experimental"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "D differentiates by IV control: full (experimental), partial (quasi), none (non-experimental).",
    "additional": "Experimental = strongest for causal inference due to control/randomization."

    "question": "The primary objective of experimental methodology is:",
    "options": {
      "A": "Ensure external validity",
      "B": "Improve internal validity",
      "C": "To eliminate type I error",
      "D": "To reduce ethical problems"

      "B": "Quota",
      "C": "Stratified random",
      "D": "Systematic"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Quota sampling is non-random and prone to bias. It fills predefined quotas using convenient selection rather than true randomization.",
    "additional": "Probability Sampling = Random & unbiased (e.g., cluster, stratified, systematic). Non-Probability Sampling = Biased (e.g., quota, convenience, purposive, snowball)."

      "D": "Permit greater depth of response"
    },
    "answer": "(B) Easy to administer",
    "explanation": "Closed-ended questions are quick, easy to answer, and simple to analyze.",
    "additional": "Use clear, unbiased questions. Avoid double-barreled or leading items. Likert = scale of agreement; Semantic = feeling spectrum (e.g., good–bad)."
