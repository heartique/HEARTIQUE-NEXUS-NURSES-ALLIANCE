      "C": "Contaminated water and test feeds given to the newborn.",
      "D": "The placenta before birth of the baby"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Toxoplasmosis is caused by the parasite Toxoplasma gondii. When a pregnant woman acquires a primary infection (e.g., from undercooked meat or contact with infected cat feces), the parasite can cross the placenta and infect the fetus.",
    "additional": "This is known as congenital toxoplasmosis, and the transmission is transplacental.\n\nTORCH Infections:\n- Toxoplasmosis\n- Other (e.g., Syphilis, Varicella-Zoster, Parvovirus B19)\n- Rubella\n- Cytomegalovirus (CMV)\n- Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV)\n\nClassic Triad of Congenital Toxoplasmosis:\n- Chorioretinitis\n- Hydrocephalus\n- Intracranial calcifications\n\nPrevention:\n- Avoid undercooked meat\n- Avoid handling cat litter during pregnancy"

      "C": "Cleft lip and palate.",
      "D": "Hydrocephalus"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Folic acid is essential for neural tube closure during early embryonic development. Deficiency can result in Neural Tube Defects (NTDs), especially spina bifida.",
    "additional": "The neural tube closes by day 28 post-conception—often before pregnancy is confirmed.\n\nOther NTDs:\n- Anencephaly\n\nNot Related:\n- A. Phocomelia – linked to thalidomide, not folic acid\n- C. Cleft lip/palate – multifactorial cause\n- D.

    "question": "An infant's immune system can effectively respond to immune threats during the first month of birth because",
    "options": {
      "A": "Limited antibodies are produced by the infant's colonic bacteria.",
      "B": "Antibodies are passively received from the mother through the placenta and breast milk.",
      "C": "Exposure to pathogens during this period is limited.",
      "D": "Limited antibodies are produced by the foetal thymus gland in the first months of gestation"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This describes passive immunity. An infant's own immune system is immature at birth. They are protected for the first several months of life by antibodies they received from their mother. IgG antibodies are small enough to cross the placenta during gestation. After birth, IgA antibodies are transferred to the infant through breast milk (especially the colostrum), providing protection against respiratory and gastrointestinal infections. This maternal protection is crucial while the infant's immune system develops and they begin to receive vaccinations.",
    "additional": "A: Colonic bacteria are part of the gut microbiome and play a role in immunity, but they do not produce antibodies.\nC: Exposure to pathogens is certainly not limited after birth; the infant is immediately exposed to a world of microbes.\nD: The thymus gland is where T-cells mature; it does not produce antibodies (B-cells do). Furthermore, the fetal immune system produces very few antibodies on its own.\n\nActive vs. Passive Immunity:\nActive: The body produces its own antibodies in response to an infection (natural active) or a vaccine (artificial active). It is long-lasting.\nPassive: Antibodies are received from an outside source (e.g., mother to baby, or an injection of immunoglobulin). It is immediate but temporary.\n\nTypes of Immunoglobulins:\nIgG: Most abundant, crosses the placenta.\nIgA: Found in secretions (tears, saliva, breast milk).\nIgM: The first antibody produced in response to a new infection.\nIgE: Involved in allergic reactions."

    "question": "The use of toothpaste in very young children is not recommended because:-",
    "options": {
      "A": "The fluid nature of their diet minimizes the risk of dental carries",
      "B": "They do not like the taste",
      "C": "Swallowing the paste predisposes to fluorosis.",
      "D": "The teeth are still developing"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Fluoride is very effective at preventing dental caries (cavities), but excessive ingestion during the period of tooth enamel formation (up to about age 8) can cause dental fluorosis. This condition causes changes in the appearance of tooth enamel, ranging from faint white streaks to more severe brown staining and pitting. Since very young children have not yet mastered the ability to spit effectively, they tend to swallow toothpaste. Using a non-fluoridated toothpaste or only a tiny smear (the size of a grain of rice) of fluoridated toothpaste minimizes this risk.",
    "additional": "A: The fluid/soft nature of an infant's diet does not minimize the risk of caries, especially once sugars are introduced. \"Baby bottle tooth decay\" is a significant problem.\nB: While some children may not like the taste, this is not the primary medical reason for the recommendation.\nD: The fact that teeth are developing is precisely why fluorosis is a risk, but it's the swallowing of excess fluoride that is the direct cause.\n\nDental Care Recommendations for Children:\n- Begin cleaning gums with a soft cloth even before teeth erupt.\n- Use a rice-sized smear of fluoridated toothpaste from the first tooth until age 3.\n- Use a pea-sized amount from age 3 to 6.\n- First dental visit should be by age 1 or within 6 months of the first tooth erupting.\n\nPrevention of Early Childhood Caries:\n- Avoid putting a baby to bed with a bottle of milk or juice.\n- Do not use a bottle as a pacifier."

    "question": "Diagnosis of twin pregnancy during inspection of the abdomen becomes apparent when:-",
    "options": {
      "A": "The abdominal length appears longer than normal.",
      "B": "Linear nigra appears darker and longer than normal.",
      "C": "The uterus/abdomen may look broad or round",
      "D": "When foetal movements are fewer than normal."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "A uterus containing two fetuses will be larger and more stretched than one containing a single fetus. This can make the abdomen appear unusually broad or round for the gestational age. However, the most reliable clinical measurement is fundal height.",
    "additional": "A: \"Abdominal length\" is a vague and non-standard term.\nB: Linea nigra is a hormonal change and its appearance is not a reliable indicator of twins.\nD: One would expect more fetal movements, not fewer, with two fetuses.\n\nFundal Height: This is the measurement from the pubic symphysis to the top of the uterine fundus. In a singleton pregnancy, the fundal height in centimeters roughly corresponds to the weeks of gestation (e.g., at 24 weeks, the fundal height should be about 24 cm). In a twin pregnancy, the fundal height will be significantly greater than expected for the dates. This discrepancy is the key clinical finding that suggests a multiple gestation.\n\nConfirmation of Multiple Gestation: Ultrasound is the definitive method for diagnosing a twin pregnancy.\n\nComplications of Multiple Gestation: Increased risk of preterm labor, pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, and anemia for the mother. Increased risk of low birth weight and prematurity for the fetuses.\n\nTypes of Twins:\n- Dizygotic (Fraternal): Two separate eggs fertilized by two separate sperm.\n- Monozygotic (Identical): One fertilized egg splits into two."

      "C": "Multiple pregnancy",
      "D": "Pregnancy induced hypertension"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "A primigravida is a woman pregnant for the first time. The adequacy of her pelvis for a vaginal delivery is untested. Cephalopelvic disproportion (CPD) is a mismatch between the size of the fetal head (\"cephalo\") and the size of the maternal pelvis. This is a common reason for a \"failure to progress\" during labor, where the cervix fails to dilate or the fetus fails to descend despite adequate contractions, ultimately necessitating a C-section.",
    "additional": "A: IUGR may require early delivery, but a trial of labor is often attempted first if the fetus is not in distress.\nC: A multiple pregnancy is a common indication, but CPD is more frequent overall when considering all first-time mothers.\nD: PIH or pre-eclampsia may require a C-section, especially if severe or if induction of labor fails, but it is not the most common indication.\n\nThe \"3 Ps\" of Labor:\n- Passenger (the fetus: size, presentation, position)\n- Passage (the pelvis)\n- Powers (uterine contractions)\n\nCPD represents a problem with the relationship between the Passenger and the Passage.\n\nOther Major Indications for C-Section: Fetal distress, breech presentation, placenta previa, previous classical C-section.\n\nVBAC (Vaginal Birth After Cesarean): The criteria and risks associated with attempting a vaginal delivery after a prior C-section."

      "D": "Thyroid gland"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This is a key point in neuroendocrinology. The hormones of the posterior pituitary (Oxytocin and Antidiuretic Hormone/ADH) are synthesized (produced) in the cell bodies of neurons located within the hypothalamus. They are then transported down the axons of these neurons to the posterior pituitary, where they are stored and released into the bloodstream.",
    "additional": "C: Neurohypophysis is the anatomical name for the posterior pituitary. It stores and releases oxytocin but does not synthesize it.\nB: Adenohypophysis is the anterior pituitary, responsible for synthesizing hormones like TSH, ACTH, GH, LH, FSH, and prolactin.\nD: The thyroid gland produces thyroid hormones (T3 and T4), not oxytocin.\n\nFunctions of Oxytocin:\n- Stimulates uterine contractions during labor.\n- Stimulates the milk let-down reflex during breastfeeding.\n- Plays a role in social bonding.\n\nPitocin: The synthetic form of oxytocin used to induce or augment labor.\n\nHormones of the Anterior Pituitary: Know the hormones and their target organs/functions.\n\nFeedback Loops: Hormones from target glands (like cortisol or thyroid hormone) provide negative feedback to the hypothalamus and pituitary."

      "C": "Diarrhea",
      "D": "Constipation"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Loperamide is an antidiarrheal medication that slows intestinal movement by acting on opioid receptors in the gut. This allows more time for water absorption in the colon, making stools firmer and reducing their frequency. It is especially effective in treating non-infectious diarrhea.",
    "additional": "Why A, B, and D are incorrect:\n- A: Loperamide is not a painkiller; it may only relieve cramping if diarrhea is present.\n- B: It has no effect on vomiting; it's not an antiemetic.\n- D: It is contraindicated in constipation because it slows bowel movements further.\n\nOther Key Points:\n- Avoid use in infections like C. difficile or E. coli O157:H7.\n- Priority in diarrhea treatment: oral rehydration and electrolyte replacement.\n- Other antidiarrheals include bismuth subsalicylate and adsorbents like kaolin-pectin."

      "A": "Chest X-ray",
      "B": "Stool culture",
      "C": "Throat swab for culture",
      "D": "Urinalysis"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This question tests knowledge of the standard diagnostic procedure for a common pediatric infection.\n\nStreptococcal Pharyngitis (Strep Throat): This is a bacterial infection of the throat and tonsils caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus).\n\nThroat Swab for Culture: This is the gold standard for diagnosis. A sterile swab is used to collect a sample from the posterior pharynx and tonsils. The sample is then cultured in a lab to see if Group A Streptococcus bacteria grow.\n\nRapid Antigen Detection Test (RADT): Often done first in the clinic. It provides results in minutes. If the RADT is positive, treatment is started. If it is negative but suspicion is high, a throat culture is still recommended in children and adolescents because the culture is more sensitive and can detect infections the rapid test might miss.\n\nA, B, and D are incorrect as they test for respiratory, gastrointestinal, and renal/metabolic issues, respectively, not a throat infection.",
    "additional": "1. Importance of Treating Strep Throat:\n\nThe primary reason for diagnosing and treating strep throat with antibiotics (usually penicillin or amoxicillin) is not just to relieve symptoms, but to prevent serious post-streptococcal complications.\n\nRheumatic Fever: A serious inflammatory condition that can affect the heart (causing rheumatic heart disease), joints, brain, and skin.\n\nPost-Streptococcal Glomerulonephritis (PSGN): Inflammation of the glomeruli in the kidneys, which can lead to kidney damage.\n\n2. Differentiating Viral vs. Bacterial Pharyngitis:\n\nMost sore throats in children are viral. Clinical signs suggesting bacterial (strep) pharyngitis include:\n- Sudden onset of sore throat\n- Fever\n- Tonsillar exudates (pus on tonsils)\n- Swollen, tender anterior cervical lymph nodes\n- Absence of cough, rhinorrhea (runny nose), and conjunctivitis (these suggest a viral cause).\n\nFuture Question Idea: \"A mother asks why her child with a sore throat needs an antibiotic.

      "C": "Hearing loss and balance problems",
      "D": "Skin rash and joint pain"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This question asks about the common complications of otitis media (middle ear infection).\n\nOtitis Media with Effusion (OME): Fluid can remain trapped in the middle ear after an infection clears. This sterile fluid can interfere with the movement of the tiny bones of the middle ear (ossicles), leading to conductive hearing loss.\n\nBalance Problems: The middle and inner ear are crucial for balance (the vestibular system). Inflammation and fluid can disrupt this system, leading to dizziness or unsteadiness.\n\nA and B can be symptoms of the acute infection itself, but persistent hearing loss and balance issues are key complications to monitor for after the initial diagnosis.\n\nD) Skin rash and joint pain are characteristic of other conditions, like rheumatic fever or Kawasaki disease, not typical complications of otitis media.",
    "additional": "1. Other Complications of Otitis Media:\n\n- Tympanic Membrane Perforation: The eardrum can rupture due to pressure from fluid buildup, usually resulting in purulent drainage from the ear.\n\n- Mastoiditis: A serious (but rare) complication where the infection spreads to the mastoid bone behind the ear. Signs include pain, swelling, and redness behind the ear. This is a medical emergency.\n\n- Chronic Suppurative Otitis Media (CSOM): A persistent infection with a perforated eardrum and ongoing drainage.\n\n- Speech and Language Delay: Recurrent infections and persistent hearing loss during critical developmental years can lead to delays in speech.\n\nFuture Question Idea: \"A parent calls the clinic a week after their child was diagnosed with otitis media, stating the child now has foul-smelling drainage from the ear. The nurse should suspect which condition?\" (Answer: Tympanic membrane perforation)."

      "A": "Administering an antiemetic",
      "B": "Starting an intravenous (IV) line",
      "C": "Providing oral rehydration solution",
      "D": "Offering a bottle of formula"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The key information here is the infant's age (3 months) and the signs of dehydration (vomiting, diarrhea, appears dehydrated). For an infant, dehydration can become life-threatening very quickly.\n\nPriority: Rehydration. The immediate goal is to correct fluid and electrolyte imbalances.\n\nWhy IV? The infant is actively vomiting, which means they will likely not be able to tolerate oral rehydration solution (ORS). In cases of moderate to severe dehydration, especially with ongoing vomiting, intravenous (IV) fluid therapy is the priority to ensure rapid and effective rehydration.\n\nOral Rehydration (C): This is the first-line treatment for mild to moderate dehydration, but it is contraindicated or less effective if the child is vomiting persistently, has severe dehydration, or shows signs of shock.\n\nAntiemetic (A): May be used later, but correcting the fluid deficit is the first priority.\n\nFormula (D): Not appropriate for rehydration and may worsen diarrhea.",
    "additional": "1. Assessing Dehydration in Infants:\n\nNurses must be able to rapidly assess the degree of dehydration.\n\n- Mild: Alert, thirsty, normal vital signs, moist mucous membranes.\n- Moderate: Irritable or lethargic, sunken eyes, dry mucous membranes, decreased skin turgor, tachycardia.\n- Severe: Lethargic to comatose, very sunken eyes, parched mucous membranes, poor skin turgor (\"tenting\"), signs of shock (tachycardia, cool extremities, weak pulses, prolonged capillary refill >3 seconds).\n\n2. Intravenous Fluid Resuscitation:\n\n- Fluid of Choice: Isotonic crystalloid solution, such as Normal Saline (0.9% NaCl) or Lactated Ringer's.\n- Bolus Administration: In severe dehydration, a rapid IV bolus is given. A typical bolus for a child is 20 mL/kg administered over a short period (e.g., 15-30 minutes), which can be repeated.\n\nFuture Question Idea: \"A 6-month-old infant is brought to the emergency department with severe dehydration.

    "options": {
      "A": "Take two puffs of the inhaler at a time",
      "B": "Inhale quickly and deeply",
      "C": "Shake the inhaler vigorously before each puff",
      "D": "Wait 1 minute between puffs if taking more than one"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This question tests knowledge of correct MDI with spacer technique.\n\nWaiting 1 Minute (D): This is a critical step. The first puff of a bronchodilator like albuterol begins to open the airways. Waiting one minute allows the airways to open more fully, so the second puff can penetrate deeper into the lungs and be more effective.\n\nOne Puff at a Time (A): The child should take only one puff, hold their breath, and then exhale before preparing for the next puff. Delivering two puffs into the spacer at once is incorrect.\n\nInhale Slowly and Deeply (B): A quick inhalation will cause the medication to impact the back of the throat instead of being drawn into the lungs. The spacer is designed to facilitate a slow, deep breath. Many spacers will \"whistle\" if the child inhales too quickly, providing useful feedback.\n\nShake the Inhaler (C): This is a correct and important step to mix the medication and propellant, but waiting between puffs is a commonly missed step that directly impacts efficacy.",
    "additional": "1. Steps for Using an MDI with a Spacer:\n\n- Remove caps.\n- Shake the inhaler well.\n- Insert the inhaler into the spacer.\n- Breathe out completely.\n- Place the spacer mouthpiece in the mouth, creating a tight seal with the lips.\n- Press down on the inhaler one time to release one puff of medication into the spacer.\n- Breathe in slowly and deeply over 3-5 seconds.\n- Hold breath for 10 seconds.\n- Exhale slowly.\n- If a second puff is needed, wait one full minute and repeat the steps.\n\n2. Importance of the Spacer (Valved Holding Chamber):\n\n- A spacer overcomes the main problem with MDIs: the need for perfect hand-breath coordination.\n- It slows down the aerosol spray and holds it in the chamber, allowing the user to inhale it slowly and deeply.\n- It reduces the amount of medication deposited in the mouth and throat, which decreases side effects (like thrush with inhaled corticosteroids) and increases the amount of drug delivered to the lungs.\n\nFuture Question Idea: \"A parent asks the nurse why their child needs to use a spacer with their asthma inhaler. The nurse's best response is that the spacer:\" (Answer: \"Helps more medication get into the lungs instead of the mouth.\")."

      "B": "Aplastic crisis",
      "C": "Splenic sequestration crisis",
      "D": "Acute chest syndrome"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This question describes the hallmark symptom of sickle cell disease.\n\nVaso-occlusive Crisis (VOC): This is the most common type of crisis and the most frequent reason for hospitalization. It occurs when the sickle-shaped red blood cells clump together and block blood flow in small blood vessels (vaso-occlusion). This blockage prevents oxygen from reaching tissues, causing ischemia and leading to sudden, severe pain. The pain can occur anywhere but is common in the bones of the arms, legs, back, and chest.\n\nAplastic Crisis (B): A temporary cessation of red blood cell production in the bone marrow, often triggered by a viral infection (like Parvovirus B19). It presents with severe anemia and pallor, not focal pain.\n\nSplenic Sequestration (C): A life-threatening complication where a large number of sickled cells get trapped in the spleen, causing it to enlarge rapidly. This leads to a sudden, severe drop in hemoglobin, abdominal pain, and can cause hypovolemic shock. It is most common in young children.\n\nAcute Chest Syndrome (D): A vaso-occlusive crisis in the lungs, presenting like pneumonia with chest pain, fever, cough, and hypoxia. It is a leading cause of death in patients with sickle cell disease.",
    "additional": "1. Nursing Management of a Vaso-occlusive Crisis:\n\nThe priorities are summarized by the acronym \"HOP\":\n\nH - Hydration: IV fluids (and oral fluids) are crucial to decrease blood viscosity and help flush the sickled cells through the vessels.\n\nO - Oxygenation: Oxygen is administered if the patient is hypoxic (SpO2 < 92-94%) to prevent further sickling.\n\nP - Pain Management: This is the top priority from the patient's perspective. Strong opioid analgesics (like morphine) are typically required and should be administered on a schedule, not just \"as needed,\" to stay ahead of the severe pain.\n\n2. Health Maintenance and Prevention for Sickle Cell Disease:\n\n- Prophylactic Penicillin: Given to children from birth until at least age 5 to prevent life-threatening pneumococcal sepsis.\n- Vaccinations: Crucial to get all routine childhood vaccines, plus additional ones for Pneumococcus, Meningococcus, and Influenza.\n- Folic Acid: Supplementation is given to support red blood cell production.\n- Hydroxyurea: A medication that can increase the production of fetal hemoglobin (HbF), which does not sickle. This reduces the frequency of VOCs and acute chest syndrome.\n\nFuture Question Idea: \"What is the priority nursing intervention for a child admitted with a sickle cell vaso-occlusive crisis?\" (Answer: Administering intravenous fluids and pain medication)."
