    "question": "A client is being brought into the emergency department after suffering a head injury. The first action by the nurse is to determine the client's:",
    "options": {
      "A": "Level of consciousness",
      "B": "Pulse and Blood Pressure",
      "C": "Respiratory rate and depth",
      "D": "Ability to move extremities"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "In the initial assessment of a patient with a head injury, the highest priority is the neurological exam. The level of consciousness (LOC) is the single most important and sensitive indicator of neurological status and any changes in it. A decrease in LOC is the earliest sign of increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Assessing LOC using tools like the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) establishes a critical baseline against which all future changes can be measured.",
    "additional": "Why B, C, and D are incorrect:\nB & C: Changes in vital signs, especially those in Cushing's Triad, are often late signs of increased ICP. Respiratory patterns matter, but LOC changes are more immediate.\nD: Assessing motor function is important, but LOC takes precedence as the earliest indicator.\n\nAdditional Possible Content to be Tested Next:\n- Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS): Know the components (Eye Opening, Verbal Response, Motor Response) and scoring (3–15). A score ≤8 usually indicates severe injury.\n- Types of Head Injuries: Concussion, contusion, epidural hematoma, subdural hematoma.\n- Signs of Basilar Skull Fracture: Battle’s Sign (bruising behind the ear), Raccoon Eyes (periorbital ecchymosis)."

    "question": "The nurse evaluates a client following treatment for carbon monoxide poisoning. The nurse would document that the treatment was effective if which of the following were present?",
    "options": {
      "A": "The client is sleeping soundly",
      "B": "The client is awake and talking",
      "C": "The heart monitor shows sinus tachycardia",
      "D": "Carboxyhemoglobin levels are less than 5%"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Carbon monoxide (CO) binds to hemoglobin with an affinity over 200 times that of oxygen, forming carboxyhemoglobin (COHb). This prevents hemoglobin from carrying oxygen, causing tissue hypoxia. The most definitive measure of both poisoning severity and treatment effectiveness is the serum carboxyhemoglobin level. Effective treatment (with 100% oxygen or hyperbaric oxygen) reduces this level to <5% for non-smokers.",
    "additional": "Why A, B, and C are incorrect:\nA & B: Being awake or sleeping does not confirm the COHb level has normalized. Clinical improvement may not reflect biochemical recovery.\nC: Sinus tachycardia is a sign of hypoxia during poisoning, not an indication of recovery.\n\nAdditional Possible Content to be Tested Next:\n- CO Poisoning Symptoms: Headache, dizziness, nausea, confusion. Cherry-red skin is rare and a late sign.\n- Pulse Oximetry Limitation: Standard pulse oximeters cannot detect COHb. A co-oximeter is needed.\n- Treatment: 100% oxygen via non-rebreather mask. Hyperbaric oxygen for severe poisoning."

    "question": "The nurse is planning care for a client with a T3 spinal cord injury. The nurse includes which intervention in the plan to prevent autonomic dysreflexia (hyperreflexia)?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Administer dexamethasone (Decadron) as per the physician's prescription",
      "B": "Assist the client to develop a daily bowel routine to prevent constipation",
      "C": "Teach the client that this condition is relatively minor with few symptoms",
      "D": "Assess vital signs and observe for hypotension, tachycardia, and tachypnea"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD) is a medical emergency that occurs in clients with spinal cord injuries at T6 or above. It is caused by a noxious stimulus below the injury, leading to excessive sympathetic discharge. The most common triggers are a full bladder or bowel. Preventing constipation through a daily bowel routine removes one of the major triggers, making this a critical preventive nursing intervention.",
    "additional": "Why A, C, and D are incorrect:\n- A: Dexamethasone reduces inflammation but does not prevent AD.\n- C: This is dangerous misinformation. AD is life-threatening, not minor.\n- D: These are not the correct signs of AD. AD presents with severe hypertension, headache, and reflex bradycardia.\n\nAdditional Content:\n- Other AD Triggers: Bladder distention, tight clothing, pressure injuries.\n- Emergency Management:\n  • Sit patient upright to reduce BP.\n  • Loosen clothing.\n  • Locate/remove trigger (check bladder/bowel).\n  • Administer antihypertensives if needed."

    "question": "A client admitted to the hospital for repair of an unruptured cerebral aneurysm. Which assessment finding would be noted first if the aneurysm ruptures?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Widened pulse pressure",
      "B": "Unilateral motor weakness",
      "C": "Unilateral slowing of pupil response",
      "D": "A decline in the level of consciousness"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "A ruptured cerebral aneurysm causes bleeding into the subarachnoid space (subarachnoid hemorrhage), which leads to a rapid rise in intracranial pressure. The earliest and most sensitive indicator of increased ICP is a change in level of consciousness. This may begin as confusion or lethargy and quickly progress to coma. Patients also report a sudden, severe headache — often described as the worst of their life.",
    "additional": "Why A, B, and C are incorrect:\n- A: Widened pulse pressure is part of Cushing’s triad, a late sign.\n- B & C: These are focal neurologic signs that may occur later. LOC changes first.\n\nAdditional Content:\n- SAH Signs: Thunderclap headache, nuchal rigidity, nausea/vomiting, photophobia.\n- Aneurysm Precautions:\n  • Maintain stable BP.\n  • Prevent straining and stress.\n  • Quiet environment, limited stimuli.\n  • Stool softeners to prevent Valsalva effect during bowel movement."

    "question": "The following technique should be avoided when changing a hemiparalysis client's position in bed:",
    "options": {
      "A": "Sliding the client to move her up in bed",
      "B": "Rolling the client onto her side",
      "C": "Lifting the client when moving her up in bed",
      "D": "Having the client lift herself off the bed using a trapeze"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Sliding the client across bed linens causes shearing force and friction, which are especially dangerous in patients with paralysis or stroke due to fragile skin. Friction abrades the skin surface, and shearing tears blood vessels in deeper tissue layers. This can cause pressure injuries or deep tissue damage.",
    "additional": "Rolling with a draw sheet is correct. Lifting is ideal to prevent friction. Using a trapeze (with the unaffected arm) promotes independence and reduces skin trauma. Pressure injury prevention includes frequent repositioning, pressure-relieving surfaces, and proper support of affected limbs. Reference: Brunner & Suddarth, 14th Ed., Ch. 10 & 62."

  {
    "question": "Neurovascular assessment of the lower limb post-cast application involves observation of:",
    "options": {
      "A": "Color, sensation and pulses",
      "B": "Level of consciousness, limb symmetry and muscular strength",
      "C": "Capillary refill, sensation and muscle power",
      "D": "Color, warmth and muscle power"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Capillary refill checks circulation (<3 seconds is normal). Sensation assesses nerve integrity—watch for tingling, numbness, or loss of feeling. Muscle power checks motor function—can the patient move their toes? These are all essential after applying a cast to detect compartment syndrome or nerve compromise.",
    "additional": "6 Ps: Pain, Pallor, Pulselessness, Paresthesia, Paralysis, Poikilothermia. Unrelieved pain is the earliest sign of compartment syndrome. NCK may ask what to report immediately (e.g., 'pain unrelieved by morphine'). Reference: Brunner & Suddarth, 14th Ed., Ch. 39."

  {
    "question": "The priority indicator of increasing intracranial pressure is:",
    "options": {
      "A": "Unequal pupil size",
      "B": "Decreasing systolic pressure",
      "C": "Tachycardia",
      "D": "Decreasing body temperature"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Among the given options, unequal pupil size is the best indicator of increasing ICP due to cranial nerve III compression. It reflects direct neurologic deterioration. However, the true earliest sign of IICP is a change in level of consciousness (LOC), which is not listed here.",
    "additional": "Bradycardia and increased systolic pressure (Cushing's triad) are late signs. Hypothermia is not associated with IICP—hyperthermia is more common. NCK may ask for earliest vs. most ominous signs. Reference: Brunner & Suddarth, 14th Ed., Ch. 61."
  },
  {
    "question": "The frontal lobe of the brain is:",
    "options": {
      "A": "The primary receptive area for vision",
      "B": "Mainly responsible for auditory sensation and coordination",
      "C": "Centre for respiratory and vasomotor activity",
      "D": "Responsible for abstract thinking, judgment and emotions"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The frontal lobe controls higher-order thinking like judgment, abstract reasoning, and emotion regulation. It also includes the motor cortex and Broca's area for speech. It plays a crucial role in personality and behavior.",
    "additional": "Option A is incorrect—the occipital lobe handles vision. Option B—auditory sensation is temporal lobe; coordination is cerebellum. Option C describes brainstem functions. NCK often tests brain lobe roles. Reference: Brunner & Suddarth, Ch. 60."

  {
    "question": "A client has just undergone spinal fusion after experiencing herniation of a lumbar disk. The nurse would avoid which intervention to maintain client safety after this procedure?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Use the overhead trapeze.",
      "B": "Keep the head of the bed flat.",
      "C": "Place pillows under the length of the legs.",
      "D": "Use logrolling technique for repositioning."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Pillows under the legs can cause hip flexion and compress popliteal veins, increasing the risk of DVT and misaligning the spine. Maintaining neutral spine alignment is the top priority after spinal surgery.",
    "additional": "Logrolling (D) prevents twisting. Trapeze (A) allows safe movement. Flat bed (B) avoids spinal flexion. 'BLT' rule: No Bending, Lifting, Twisting. Reference: Brunner & Suddarth, Ch. 63."
  },
  {
    "question": "Post intracranial surgery a patient requires strict temperature regulation mainly to:",
    "options": {
      "A": "Detect infection",
      "B": "Prevent increased metabolic demand",
      "C": "Prevent hypothermia",
      "D": "Enhance cerebral perfusion"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The injured brain cannot handle increased demand. Fever raises metabolic rate, increasing oxygen/glucose needs. This leads to ischemia if cerebral blood flow can't keep up, causing further injury.",
    "additional": "Detecting infection (A) is important but not the main reason for *control*. Hypothermia (C) is rare post-surgery. Perfusion (D) is affected secondarily. Key is to prevent the metabolic-ICP spiral. Reference: Brunner & Suddarth, Ch. 61."
  },
  {
    "question": "Management of a patient during a seizure include:",
    "options": {
      "A": "Restricting the jerking movements to prevent injury",
      "B": "Inserting an oral airway to protect the tongue",
      "C": "Putting pillows and raising the side rails if the patient is in bed",
      "D": "Removing pillows and raising the side rails if the patient is in bed."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "During a seizure, the priority is safety. Raising side rails and padding the area prevents injury. Placing pillows protects the head from striking the bed or rail.",
    "additional": "NEVER restrain movements (A) or insert objects in the mouth (B). Removing pillows (D) is incorrect unless they block the airway. Turn the patient to the side, observe duration and behavior, and document post-seizure. Reference: Brunner & Suddarth, Ch. 63."

  {
    "question": "When a nurse is monitoring a patient for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak he/she should observe for:",
    "options": {
      "A": "Halo sign.",
      "B": "Babinski reflex.",
      "C": "Iliopsoas sign.",
      "D": "Blumberg sign."
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The Halo sign is a ring-like yellowish fluid pattern surrounding blood, indicating CSF leakage. This may appear on gauze from nasal or ear discharge after trauma or surgery.",
    "additional": "Babinski (B) tests CNS damage. Iliopsoas (C) and Blumberg (D) test for appendicitis/peritonitis. Monitor for meningitis, avoid packing or blocking drainage, and test drainage for glucose. Reference: Brunner & Suddarth, Ch. 61."

  {
    "question": "Fractures of the base of the skull will manifest with",
    "options": {
      "A": "Hemorrhage from the nose, the pharynx or the ears",
      "B": "Cerebrospinal fluid leakage from the ears",
      "C": "Bloody spinal fluid",
      "D": "Persistent localized pain on swelling"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "CSF otorrhea (leak from the ears) is a hallmark sign of a basilar skull fracture due to a tear in the dura. Test fluid for glucose or halo effect.",
    "additional": "Hemorrhage (A) may occur but isn’t specific. Bloody CSF (C) is found via lumbar puncture, which is contraindicated in increased ICP. Pain/swelling (D) is nonspecific. Look for Battle’s sign, Raccoon eyes, and CSF leak. Reference: Brunner & Suddarth, Ch. 61."

  {
    "question": "Which cranial nerve is involved when the patient presents with facial pain, diminished corneal reflex and chewing dysfunction:",
    "options": {
      "A": "III",
      "B": "IV",
      "C": "V",
      "D": "VI"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Cranial Nerve V (Trigeminal) has both sensory and motor functions. It is responsible for facial sensation, the corneal reflex, and chewing movements. Dysfunction leads to pain, reflex loss, and chewing issues.",
    "additional": "CN V has three sensory branches and motor control over mastication. CNs III, IV, and VI control eye movement only. Corneal reflex involves CN V (sensory) and CN VII (motor). Mnemonics: 'Oh Oh Oh To Touch And Feel Very Good Velvet, AH Heaven' and 'Some Say Marry Money...'. Reference: Brunner & Suddarth, Ch. 60."

  {
    "question": "The nurse administers mannitol to the client with increased intracranial pressure. Which parameter needs close monitoring?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Muscle relaxation",
      "B": "Intake and output",
      "C": "Widening of the pulse pressure",
      "D": "Pupil dilation"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic that draws fluid out of the brain and into circulation. It leads to diuresis, so fluid balance must be monitored closely.",
    "additional": "Monitor for dehydration, electrolyte loss, rebound ICP, and pulmonary edema. Always use an in-line filter. Crackles in the lungs, rising osmolality, or low output are red flags. Reference: Brunner & Suddarth, Ch. 61."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which activity should the nurse encourage the client to avoid when there is a risk for increased intracranial pressure (ICP)?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Deep breathing",
      "B": "Coughing",
      "C": "Turning",
      "D": "Passive range of motion (ROM) exercises"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Coughing increases intrathoracic pressure, which impedes cerebral venous return and raises ICP. It should be minimized in patients at risk.",
    "additional": "Avoid straining, vomiting, sneezing. Maintain head neutral and HOB at 30°. Avoid clustering care. Deep breathing and ROM are safe. Suctioning raises ICP—do only when necessary. Reference: Brunner & Suddarth, Ch. 61."

  {
    "question": "For a client who is experiencing expressive aphasia, which nursing intervention is most helpful in promoting communication?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Speaking loudly",
      "B": "Using a picture board",
      "C": "Writing directions so client can read them",
      "D": "Speaking in short sentences"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Expressive aphasia affects the ability to speak or write, but comprehension remains intact. A picture board allows the patient to express needs nonverbally, reducing frustration.",
    "additional": "Loud speech is not useful since hearing is intact. Writing is often impaired. Short sentences help receptive aphasia. Picture boards are ideal for expressive aphasia. Know the differences between Broca’s (expressive), Wernicke’s (receptive), and global aphasia. Reference: Brunner & Suddarth, Ch. 62."

  {
    "question": "The nurse is assessing the motor and sensory function of an unconscious client. The nurse should use which technique to test the client’s peripheral response to pain?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Sternal rub",
      "B": "Nail bed pressure",
      "C": "Pressure on the orbital rim",
      "D": "Squeezing of the sternocleidomastoid muscle"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Nail bed pressure is a peripheral pain stimulus used to assess spinal cord or limb nerve function. A limb-specific response helps localize injury.",
    "additional": "Sternal rub, orbital pressure, and SCM squeeze are central stimuli. Nail bed pressure is for limb-specific testing. Always document stimulus and response clearly. Reference: Brunner & Suddarth, Ch. 60."
  },
  {
    "question": "The nurse is evaluating the neurological signs of a client in spinal shock following spinal cord injury. Which observation indicates that spinal shock persists?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Hyperreflexia",
      "B": "Positive reflexes",
      "C": "Flaccid paralysis",
      "D": "Reflex emptying of the bladder"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Flaccid paralysis indicates the spinal cord is still in shock. Reflexes and tone are absent. The condition is temporary and resolves when reflexes return.",
    "additional": "Hyperreflexia, reflex bladder emptying, and positive reflexes all indicate spinal shock is resolving. Know the difference between spinal shock and neurogenic shock. Reference: Brunner & Suddarth, Ch. 61."
  },
  {
    "question": "The nurse has instructed the family of a client with stroke (brain attack) who has homonymous hemianopsia about measures to help the client overcome the deficit. Which statement suggests that the family understands the measures to use when caring for the client?",
    "options": {
      "A": "We need to discourage him from wearing eyeglasses.",
      "B": "We need to place objects in his impaired field of vision.",
      "C": "We need to approach him from the impaired field of vision.",
      "D": "We need to remind him to turn his head to scan the lost visual field."
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Homonymous hemianopsia is the loss of half of the visual field in both eyes. Teaching the patient to turn their head to scan the missing field compensates for the visual loss and reduces safety risks.",
    "additional": "Placing objects or approaching from the impaired side can increase neglect and lead to injury. Encourage scanning behavior instead. Eyeglasses are unrelated to the neurological visual deficit. Reference: Brunner & Suddarth, Ch. 62."
  },
  {
    "question": "The nurse is teaching a client with myasthenia gravis about the prevention of myasthenic and cholinergic crisis. Which client activity suggests that teaching is most effective?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Taking medications as scheduled",
      "B": "Eating large, well-balanced meals",
      "C": "Doing muscle-strengthening exercises",
      "D": "Doing all chores early in the day while less fatigued"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Taking anticholinesterase medications on a strict schedule helps maintain therapeutic blood levels and prevents myasthenic or cholinergic crises. Medication timing is key.",
    "additional": "Large meals fatigue the patient. Strenuous exercise worsens weakness. Doing chores early helps conserve energy, but it does not directly prevent crises. Reference: Brunner & Suddarth, Ch. 63."
  },
  {
    "question": "The nurse has given suggestions to a client with trigeminal neuralgia about strategies to minimize episodes of pain. The nurse determines that the client needs further teaching if the client makes which statement?",
    "options": {
      "A": "I will wash my face with cotton pads.",
      "B": "I’ll have to start chewing on my unaffected side.",
      "C": "I should not rinse my mouth if toothbrushing is painful.",
      "D": "I should rinse my mouth if toothbrushing is painful."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Oral hygiene must still be maintained in trigeminal neuralgia, even if brushing is painful. Rinsing with lukewarm mouthwash is a safe alternative and should not be avoided.",
    "additional": "Soft cotton for washing and chewing on the unaffected side help prevent triggering pain. Option D is correct behavior. Reference: Brunner & Suddarth, Ch. 63."
  },
  {
    "question": "The client is admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of Guillain-Barré syndrome. Which past medical history finding makes the client most at risk for this disease?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Meningitis or encephalitis during the last 5 years",
      "B": "Seizures or trauma to the brain within the last year",
      "C": "Back injury or trauma to the spinal cord during the last 2 years",
      "D": "Respiratory or gastrointestinal infection during the previous month"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) often follows a respiratory or gastrointestinal infection. In about two-thirds of cases, this type of infection is reported within 1 to 3 weeks before symptoms appear.",
    "additional": "The most common trigger is Campylobacter jejuni. GBS causes ascending paralysis and can lead to respiratory failure if not monitored. Options A–C involve central nervous system disorders or trauma, which are not typical triggers of GBS. Reference: Brunner & Suddarth, Ch. 63."

      "B": "Affect is flat, with periods of emotional lability",
      "C": "Cannot recall what was eaten for breakfast today",
      "D": "Demonstrates inability to add and subtract; does not know who is the president of the United States"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The limbic system controls emotion and mood. A flat affect and emotional lability are hallmark signs of dysfunction in this area of the brain.",
    "additional": "The amygdala and hippocampus are key structures. Disorientation and poor memory may be broader cortical issues. Acalculia and general knowledge deficits are linked to parietal and frontal lobe dysfunction. Reference: Brunner & Suddarth, Ch. 60."

  {
    "question": "The nurse is evaluating the status of a client who had a craniotomy 3 days ago. Which assessment finding would indicate that the client is developing meningitis as a complication of surgery?",
    "options": {
      "A": "A negative Kernig’s sign",
      "B": "Absence of nuchal rigidity",
      "C": "A positive Brudzinski’s sign",
      "D": "A Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "A positive Brudzinski’s sign—when neck flexion causes involuntary hip and knee flexion—is a classic indicator of meningeal irritation, suggesting possible meningitis.",
    "additional": "Other signs include fever, photophobia, headache, and nuchal rigidity. A GCS of 15 indicates normal neurologic function. Diagnosis is confirmed via lumbar puncture. Reference: Brunner & Suddarth, Ch. 63."

    "question": "A male client is having a lumbar puncture performed. The nurse would plan to place the client in which position?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Side lying with pillow under the hip",
      "B": "Prone, with a pillow under the abdomen",
      "C": "Prone, in slight Trendelenburg position",
      "D": "Side-lying with legs pulled up and bent down onto chest"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The standard position for lumbar puncture is the side-lying fetal position. Pulling the knees to the chest and chin to the chest curves the spine, opening intervertebral spaces.",
    "additional": "This posture facilitates safe and accurate access to the subarachnoid space. Other positions are either ineffective (A), obstructive (B), or completely incorrect for an LP (C). Reference: Brunner & Suddarth, Ch. 60."

  {
    "question": "The nurse is positioning the female client with increased intracranial pressure. Which of the following positions would the nurse avoid?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Head midline",
      "B": "Head turned to the side",
      "C": "Neck in neutral position",
      "D": "Head of bed elevated 30 to 45 degrees"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Turning the head compresses jugular veins, reducing venous drainage from the brain and increasing ICP. The head must be midline and neutral.",
    "additional": "Positioning with HOB elevated to 30° and no hip flexion ensures optimal venous return from the brain and avoids raising ICP. Reference: Brunner & Suddarth, Ch. 61."
  },
  {
    "question": "The nurse is caring for the male client who begins to experience seizure activity while in bed. Which of the following actions by the nurse would be contraindicated?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Loosening restrictive clothing",
      "B": "Restraining the client’s limbs",
      "C": "Removing the pillow and raising padded side rails",
      "D": "Positioning the client to side, if possible, with the head flexed forward"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This is the most clearly and universally contraindicated action during a seizure. The tonic-clonic movements are powerful and involuntary. Attempting to restrain or hold the client down works against these strong muscle contractions and can lead to serious musculoskeletal injury, such as sprains, dislocations, or even fractures. The guiding principle is to protect the client from injury, not to stop the seizure movements.",
    "additional": "Loosening restrictive clothing (A) is correct for airway safety. Option C is confusing—removing a pillow can be wrong unless it's blocking the airway, while raising padded rails is a good action. Option D has a flaw: turning to the side is good, but flexing the head forward could obstruct the airway. Option B is the only universally wrong action. Do NOT restrain during seizures. Reference: Brunner & Suddarth, Ch. 63."

      "D": "the client has lost the ability to move the left arm but is able to walk independently"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Right-sided hemiparesis means weakness (not complete paralysis) on the right side of the body. It typically affects the arm, leg, face, and tongue. This is most often the result of a stroke on the opposite (left) cerebral hemisphere.",
    "additional": "Option A describes quadriplegia. Option C implies 'plegia' and underestimates leg involvement. Option D conflicts with 'right-sided' weakness. Remember: 'Hemi' = one side, 'paresis' = weakness, 'plegia' = paralysis. Also, contralateral brain control is key in stroke signs. Reference: Brunner & Suddarth, Ch. 62."

      "C": "omitting doses of medication",
      "D": "increasing intake of fatty foods"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "A myasthenic crisis is an exacerbation of myasthenia gravis characterized by severe muscle weakness that can lead to respiratory failure. It is caused by insufficient anticholinesterase medication, most commonly due to omitted or missed doses.",
    "additional": "Option A is not a trigger. Option B describes cholinergic crisis. Option D is irrelevant. Other known triggers of myasthenic crisis include infection (especially respiratory), surgery, emotional stress, and certain medications. Airway management is always the top priority.

    "question": "A male client has an impairment of cranial nerve II. Specific to this impairment, the nurse would plan to do which of the following to ensure client safety?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Speak loudly to the client",
      "B": "Test the temperature of the shower water",
      "C": "Check the temperature of the food on the delivery tray",
      "D": "Provide a clear path for ambulation without obstacles"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Cranial Nerve II is the Optic Nerve, which is responsible for vision. A patient with impairment of this nerve will have some degree of visual deficit, ranging from blurred vision to visual field loss to complete blindness. The greatest risk for a person with a visual impairment is injury from falls or bumping into objects. Therefore, the most important safety intervention is to ensure the environment is safe and predictable by providing a clear, uncluttered path for ambulation.",
    "additional": "Speaking loudly (A) is for CN VIII hearing deficits. Testing temperature of water or food (B and C) relates to sensory deficits or peripheral neuropathy. Safety tips for vision loss include using clock face orientation, consistent layout, good lighting, and guided ambulation. Visual acuity is tested with a Snellen chart.

      "C": "Place a tongue blade in the client’s mouth",
      "D": "Take measures to prevent injury"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This option represents the overarching principle of seizure management. Patient safety is the absolute first priority. All initial actions are aimed at protecting the client from harm. This includes protecting the head, clearing the area of hazards, and preventing falls. The other options are either specific actions that fall under this umbrella or are contraindicated. 'Take measures to prevent injury' is the most comprehensive and correct initial goal.",
    "additional": "A: HOB elevation is not helpful during seizures. B: Restraint is contraindicated. C: Inserting anything into the mouth is dangerous. For 'first' actions, think safety and airway. Reference: Brunner & Suddarth, Ch. 63."

      "B": "Doing muscle -strengthening exercises",
      "C": "Doing all chores early in the day while less fatigued",
      "D": "Taking medications on time to maintain therapeutic blood levels"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This question is a repeat of Type 3, Q9, emphasizing a critical concept. Both myasthenic and cholinergic crises are directly related to the level of anticholinesterase medication in the body. Myasthenic Crisis = Too little medication. Cholinergic Crisis = Too much medication. The only way to prevent these dangerous fluctuations is to maintain a stable, therapeutic drug level. This is achieved by strict adherence to the medication schedule—taking the correct dose at the prescribed time, every time. This is the most effective preventative strategy.",
    "additional": "A: Large meals are not recommended. B: Overexertion worsens symptoms. C: Energy conservation is good, but not the direct method to prevent crises. Key education: strict medication timing and early detection of crises. Reference: Brunner & Suddarth, Ch. 63. Crisis comparison table included in source."

      "C": "Involuntary muscles",
      "D": "Voluntary muscles"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The nervous system is broadly divided into motor (efferent) pathways and sensory (afferent) pathways. The motor pathways are further divided. The term 'motor pathway' in this context most commonly refers to the somatic nervous system, which is responsible for carrying signals from the brain and spinal cord to the skeletal muscles. These are the muscles we have conscious control over, hence they are voluntary muscles. This pathway allows for all purposeful movement, from walking to writing.",
    "additional": "B and C describe autonomic nervous system (ANS) functions. A stress reaction is mediated by the sympathetic nervous system and endocrine system. The motor division of the PNS includes somatic (voluntary) and autonomic (involuntary) systems. Reference: Brunner & Suddarth's Textbook of Medical-Surgical Nursing, 14th Ed., Chapter 60."

    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Wernicke's area, located in the posterior part of the temporal lobe (usually on the left side), is the primary center for language comprehension. It is responsible for interpreting and understanding the meaning of both spoken and written language. Damage to this area results in receptive aphasia, where the person can hear the words or see the text but cannot make sense of their meaning.",
    "additional": "Broca's area (A, D) is responsible for speech production, not comprehension. Association areas (B) are involved in integration and cognition but not specifically language understanding. Wernicke’s = comprehension. Broca’s = expression.

      "C": "Cerebellum",
      "D": "Corpus callosum"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder primarily caused by the death of dopamine-producing (dopaminergic) neurons in a specific part of the midbrain called the substantia nigra. Dopamine is a crucial neurotransmitter that helps to regulate movement. The loss of dopamine disrupts the normal balance with acetylcholine in the basal ganglia, leading to the classic motor symptoms of Parkinson's.",
    "additional": "Basal ganglia (B) is broader; substantia nigra (A) is the exact site. Cerebellum (C) controls coordination; corpus callosum (D) connects hemispheres. TRAP symptoms: Tremor, Rigidity, Akinesia/Bradykinesia, Postural Instability. First-line drug: Levodopa-carbidopa. Reference: Brunner & Suddarth’s, Ch. 64, 'Parkinson’s Disease' section."

    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This question is a direct test of the definition of the divisions of the nervous system. The Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) is the part of the peripheral nervous system that operates without conscious control. It regulates visceral functions essential for life, such as heart rate, digestion, respiratory rate, and glandular secretion, by controlling involuntary muscles (smooth muscle in organs and blood vessels, cardiac muscle) and glands.",
    "additional": "The Somatic nervous system (A) controls voluntary skeletal muscles. The CNS (C) is the main processing center, not the specific controller of involuntary structures. Option D is too broad—both the somatic and autonomic systems are motor pathways. The ANS has two branches: Sympathetic (fight or flight) and Parasympathetic (rest and digest).

      "C": "Autonomic nervous system",
      "D": "Somatic nervous system"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This question asks for the common functional name for the parasympathetic nervous system. Its role is to conserve energy and manage bodily functions during times of rest and recovery. This includes stimulating digestion ('eat-drink'), slowing the heart rate ('rest'), and other non-emergency functions. The phrase 'rest and digest' is the most common mnemonic, and 'eat-drink and rest' conveys the same principle.",
    "additional": "Fight or flight (A) = Sympathetic. Autonomic nervous system (C) includes both parasympathetic and sympathetic. Somatic nervous system (D) controls voluntary skeletal muscles. Mnemonics: Parasympathetic = 'D' Division (Digestion, Diuresis, Defecation); Sympathetic = 'E' Division (Exercise, Emergency, Excitement).

      "B": "Global aphasia",
      "C": "Wernicke’s aphasia",
      "D": "Conduction aphasia"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The defining characteristic of Wernicke's aphasia is a profound deficit in language comprehension. The patient cannot understand what is being said to them or what they are reading. This is why it's also called receptive aphasia. Although their speech is fluent (fluent output), it is often nonsensical and filled with errors ('word salad') because they cannot comprehend their own output to self-correct.",
    "additional": "The phrase 'intact repetition' is misleading—Wernicke's typically includes poor repetition. Conduction aphasia = fluent speech + good comprehension + poor repetition. Broca's = poor expression, good comprehension. Global = everything impaired. NCK may describe a patient who speaks fluently but nonsensically and cannot follow commands—that’s Wernicke’s aphasia.

      "C": "Administer Valium",
      "D": "Place a tongue blade in the mouth (Never do this! Places client in danger!)"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The period immediately following a seizure is called the postictal phase. During this time, the client is often unconscious or very drowsy, and their gag reflex may be impaired. The absolute priority is to maintain a patent airway and prevent aspiration of saliva, vomit, or other secretions. Placing the client in a side-lying (recovery) position allows secretions to drain out of the mouth by gravity instead of pooling in the back of the throat and being aspirated into the lungs. This is a critical safety measure based on the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation).",
    "additional": "Checking the pulse (B) is important for circulation but comes after airway protection. Administering Valium (C) is for active seizures, not the postictal phase. Placing a tongue blade (D) is dangerous and contraindicated. Postictal care involves airway management, neurologic checks, reorientation, comfort, and safety.

      "B": "Provide the client with privacy during the seizure.",
      "C": "Note the first thing the client does in the seizure.",
      "D": "Assess the size of the client’s pupils."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "While ensuring safety is the top action, this question presents a list of assessments or observations. The initial manifestation of a seizure (where it starts and how it progresses) provides critical diagnostic clues about the location of the seizure's origin in the brain (the seizure focus). This is vital information for the neurologist. Therefore, the nurse's first observational act should be to note the time of onset and exactly what happened first (e.g., 'head turned to the left,' 'eyes deviated to the right,' 'jerking began in the right hand').",
    "additional": "Incontinence (A) and pupil size (D) are noted later. Privacy (B) is not the priority over critical clinical observations. Observation of the initial manifestation is vital for diagnosis. When questions ask for the first *action*, safety is key. When they ask for the first *observation*, it’s about diagnostic value.

      "B": "Smoking",
      "C": "Obesity",
      "D": "Hypertension"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "While all the options listed are significant modifiable risk factors for stroke, hypertension (high blood pressure) is considered the single most important and controllable risk factor. Chronic, uncontrolled hypertension damages the lining of cerebral arteries, making them weak and prone to rupture (hemorrhagic stroke) or promoting the development of atherosclerosis, which can lead to blockage (ischemic stroke). Adequately controlling blood pressure can reduce the risk of stroke by up to 50%.",
    "additional": "Sedentary lifestyle, smoking, and obesity all contribute to stroke risk but often through worsening hypertension. Other key modifiable risks: A-fib (cardioembolic stroke risk), diabetes, hyperlipidemia. NCK may test the most important overall risk factor (hypertension), or give a scenario (e.g., uncontrolled A-fib) and ask for stroke risk.

      "C": "Absent deep tendon reflexes",
      "D": "Vision changes"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease where the body attacks the myelin sheath of nerves in the central nervous system (CNS). The optic nerve is part of the CNS and is very commonly one of the first and most frequently affected areas in MS. Inflammation of the optic nerve (optic neuritis) causes symptoms like blurred vision, double vision (diplopia), pain with eye movement, or central visual field defects (scotoma). Vision changes are a classic and often initial manifestation of MS.",
    "additional": "Flaccid muscles and absent reflexes are signs of lower motor neuron diseases, not MS. Tremors at rest are typical of Parkinson’s, not MS.

      "C": "Balance and equilibrium",
      "D": "Visual acuity"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The hypothalamus is the brain's primary regulatory center for the autonomic nervous system and the endocrine system. It acts as the body's thermostat. One of its most critical functions is maintaining thermoregulation (body temperature control). Damage to the hypothalamus can lead to problems with either hyperthermia or hypothermia because the body’s ability to respond to temperature changes is impaired.",
    "additional": "Thinking is controlled by the frontal lobe (A), balance by the cerebellum and vestibular system (C), and vision by the occipital lobe (D). Hypothalamic functions include temperature, hunger, thirst, fluid balance, and circadian rhythm. Reference: Brunner & Suddarth's, 14th Ed., Chapter 60: 'The Diencephalon'."

      "C": "Cranial nerves I and II",
      "D": "Cranial nerves VI and VIII"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "A safe and coordinated swallow is a complex process involving several cranial nerves, but the most important ones for the pharyngeal phase of swallowing are IX and X. CN IX (Glossopharyngeal) triggers the gag and swallow reflex. CN X (Vagus) moves the pharynx and larynx to prevent aspiration. Damage can lead to dysphagia, a major risk for aspiration.",
    "additional": "CN III is for eye movement, CN V for chewing (oral phase), CN I for smell, CN II for vision, CN VI for eye movement, and CN VIII for balance. Reference: Brunner & Suddarth's, 14th Ed., Chapter 62: 'Preventing Aspiration'."

      "C": "Give him a barbiturate",
      "D": "Place him on mechanical ventilation"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The patient's signs (unconsciousness, nonreactive pupils) are classic indicators of severely increased intracranial pressure (ICP). A lumbar puncture (LP) is absolutely contraindicated in a patient with high ICP. Performing an LP can create a pressure gradient that causes brain herniation through the foramen magnum. This is rapidly fatal due to compression of brainstem centers for breathing and heartbeat.",
    "additional": "Elevating the head (B) and mechanical ventilation (D) are therapeutic. Barbiturates (C) can reduce ICP. Always scan for high ICP before LP. Reference: Brunner & Suddarth's, 14th Ed., Chapter 60 & 61: 'Neurologic Function' and 'Management of IICP'."

This stretches and tears small blood vessels, leading to tissue ischemia and significantly increasing the risk of pressure ulcer formation. This technique must always be avoided, especially in neurologically impaired patients.\n\n(B) & (C) Why they are incorrect: These are correct and safe techniques. Rolling the client distributes pressure evenly. Lifting the client (using a draw sheet or mechanical lift) completely eliminates friction and shear, making it the ideal method for repositioning.\n\n(D) Why it's incorrect: A trapeze is an excellent tool for a client who has upper body strength on their unaffected side. It allows them to assist in repositioning, which promotes independence, strengthens muscles, and reduces the risk of injury to both the client and the nurse. It should be encouraged if the client is capable.",

It often indicates pressure on cranial nerve III (Oculomotor nerve), which can be an early or late sign depending on the speed and location of the pressure. A fixed and dilated pupil (\"blown pupil\") is a grave, late sign. It is a high-priority indicator.\n\n(B) decreasing systolic pressure: This is the opposite of what happens in Cushing's triad. Systolic pressure increases dramatically. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n(C) tachycardia: This is the opposite of what happens in Cushing's triad. The heart rate decreases (bradycardia). Tachycardia might be seen initially, but the classic late sign is bradycardia.\n\n(D) decreasing body temperature: Increased ICP can disrupt the hypothalamus, leading to changes in temperature, but it most often causes hyperthermia (fever), not a decrease.",
    "additional": "Conclusion for this question: Given that options (B), (C), and (D) describe the opposite of the classic late signs, (A) Unequal pupil size remains the most plausible correct answer among the choices, as it is a direct and critical indicator of pressure on the brain/cranial nerves.

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "(A) Why it's correct: As discussed above, slow and irregular respirations are one of the three components of Cushing's Triad. These abnormal patterns (like Cheyne-Stokes, central neurogenic hyperventilation, or ataxic breathing) indicate that the respiratory control center in the brainstem (medulla and pons) is being compressed. This is a very late and life-threatening sign of herniation.\n\n(B), (C), and (D) Why they are incorrect: While these are all signs of respiratory distress, they are not the specific pattern associated with brainstem compression from ICP. Nasal flaring and rapid, shallow breathing are general signs of hypoxia. Asymmetric chest excursion points to a unilateral lung problem like pneumothorax or flail chest."

CSF may leak from the nose (rhinorrhea) or the ears (otorrhea). Because CSF contains glucose, a simple bedside test is to check the fluid with a dextrostix; however, this can be unreliable as nasal mucus also contains some glucose. The more definitive test is the Halo or Ring sign. To perform this, the nurse lets the fluid drip onto a piece of gauze or a pillowcase.

    "explanation": "(A) Why it's correct: This option describes two of the three components of Cushing's Triad, which is the classic sign of a deteriorating condition and severely increased intracranial pressure (ICP) in a patient with a head injury. The triad consists of:\n\nWidening pulse pressure: This is the difference between the systolic and diastolic blood pressure. A rising systolic BP with a stable or falling diastolic BP indicates a widening pulse pressure (e.g., 180/80 mmHg has a pulse pressure of 100).\n\nIrregular respiratory pattern: Such as Cheyne-Stokes respirations or ataxic breathing.\n\nBradycardia: A slow, bounding pulse.\nThe presence of these signs indicates brainstem compression and is a neurological emergency.\n\n(B) Why it's incorrect: A narrowing pulse pressure is characteristic of shock or cardiac tamponade, not increasing ICP.\n\n(C) Why it's incorrect: While bradycardia is part of Cushing's triad, Kussmaul breathing (deep, rapid, sighing respirations) is a compensatory mechanism for metabolic acidosis, most commonly seen in Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA).

In this position, the patient is placed on their side with the top leg flexed. This position uses gravity to allow the tongue to fall forward, preventing it from occluding the airway, and facilitates the drainage of saliva, mucus, or vomitus out of the mouth, preventing aspiration.\n\n(A) Why it's incorrect: Recumbent (or supine, lying flat on the back) is the most dangerous position for an unconscious patient. The tongue can fall back and block the airway, and any secretions will pool in the back of the throat, leading to a high risk of aspiration.\n\n(B) Why it's incorrect: The lithotomy position (lying on the back with legs up in stirrups) is used for gynecological or urological procedures and has no therapeutic benefit for an unconscious patient.\n\n(C) Why it's incorrect: The prone position (lying flat on the stomach) can impair chest expansion and make it difficult to monitor the patient's airway and breathing.

    "explanation": "(B) Why it's correct: A basilar (or base of skull) fracture involves a break in the bones at the floor of the cranium. These fractures often tear the dura mater, the protective membrane surrounding the brain and spinal cord. This tear allows cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to leak out. If the fracture is in the anterior fossa, CSF will leak from the nose (rhinorrhea). If the fracture is in the middle fossa, CSF will leak from the ear (otorrhea).

    "explanation": "A fracture at the base of the skull (basilar skull fracture) is a serious injury because it involves a break in the bone at the floor of the cranial vault and can tear the dura mater, leading to a direct connection between the intracranial space and the sinuses or ear canals.\n\n(B) Otorrhea, sub-conjunctival bleeding: This is the best answer. Otorrhea specifically refers to the leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the ear, which is a hallmark sign of a fracture involving the petrous part of the temporal bone. While sub-conjunctival bleeding is less specific, it can be a component of periorbital ecchymosis (\"Raccoon eyes\"), another classic sign.\n\n(A) Rhinorrhea, loss of gag reflex: CSF rhinorrhea (leakage from the nose) is a classic sign, but loss of the gag reflex points to cranial nerve (IX, X) or brainstem dysfunction, which is a potential complication rather than a primary sign of the fracture itself.\n\n(C) Cervical spine 1, fracture, dilated pupils: A fracture of the C1 vertebra is a separate, though often associated, severe injury. Dilated pupils are a sign of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and uncal herniation, a severe complication, not a specific sign of a basilar fracture.\n\n(D) Glasgow coma scale of 5, constricted pupils: A GCS of 5 indicates a severe brain injury and poor level of consciousness. Pupil changes reflect pressure on cranial nerves, but are not specific to the location of the fracture at the base of the skull.",

(Spontaneous=4, To sound=3, To pressure=2, None=1).\n\nVerbal Response (V): \"Can name only 2 organs of his body\" implies confused conversation.

  "options": {
    "A": "Brain surgery does not result in much pain ad discomfort",
    "B": "Sedation may result in paradoxical increase in intra-cranial pressure",
    "C": "Papillary responses may be impaired and respirations depressed",
    "D": "Psychological dependence may occur more quickly following surgery"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "explanation": "This question is awkwardly phrased. It asks for the reason to administer narcotics but provides options that are risks or adverse effects. The most logical interpretation is that the question is asking for the most significant neurological side effect that a nurse must be aware of when administering these drugs post-neurosurgery.\n\n(c) Papillary responses may be impaired and respirations depressed: This is the best answer because it highlights the direct interference of narcotics (opioids) with the two most critical neurological vital signs. Opioids cause pupillary constriction (miosis) and respiratory depression. A change in pupil size/reactivity or respiratory pattern is a key sign of neurological deterioration (e.g., herniation). Therefore, the drug's effects can mask these critical signs, making close monitoring essential.\n\n(a) Brain surgery does not result in much pain...: This is false. Craniotomy can be very painful, and unrelieved pain itself can increase ICP.\n\n(b) ...paradoxical increase in intra-cranial pressure: This is an indirect effect. Respiratory depression from opioids can lead to CO2 retention (hypercapnia), which is a potent cerebral vasodilator and can increase ICP. However, option (c) describes the more direct effects on assessment parameters.\n\n(d) Psychological dependence...: While a long-term risk, this is not the primary acute concern in the immediate post-operative period.",
  "additional": "Balancing Act: The nurse's role is to achieve a critical balance: provide enough analgesia to control pain (which lowers ICP) without over-sedating the patient or masking vital neurological signs.\n\nDrug Choice: Often, short-acting opioids like fentanyl or smaller, frequent doses of morphine are used. Non-opioid analgesics like acetaminophen are used to reduce the overall opioid requirement.\n\nKey Nursing Action: If a patient receiving opioids post-craniotomy has a change in level of consciousness or pupil size, the nurse must consider both the drug's effect and the possibility of a new neurological event (e.g., hematoma). The surgeon must be notified immediately.\n\nPotential Future Questions: \"Why are opioids used with extreme caution in patients with a traumatic brain injury?\" The answer is because they can mask signs of increasing intracranial pressure, specifically by causing pupillary constriction and altering the level of consciousness.\n\nSuggested Reference:\n\nBrunner & Suddarth's Textbook of Medical-Surgical Nursing, 14th Edition.

      "D": "Hypocalcaemia resulting from hypothyroidism."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Chvostek's sign is a clinical test for neuromuscular excitability caused by low calcium levels in the blood (hypocalcemia).\n\n(c) Hypocalcaemia resulting from hypoparathyrodism: This is the correct answer. Hypocalcemia (low calcium) leads to increased excitability of nerves. Tapping on the facial nerve (Cranial Nerve VII) just anterior to the ear will cause a twitching of the facial muscles (a positive Chvostek's sign) in a patient with hypocalcemia. Hypoparathyroidism (underactive parathyroid glands) is a primary cause of hypocalcemia because the parathyroid glands are responsible for releasing Parathyroid Hormone (PTH), which increases blood calcium levels.\n\n(a) & (b) Hypercalcemia...: Hypercalcemia (high calcium) causes decreased neuromuscular excitability, leading to muscle weakness and lethargy. It would not cause a positive Chvostek's sign.\n\n(d) ...hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid gland) primarily affects metabolism and does not directly cause hypocalcemia. The parathyroid glands, not the thyroid gland, regulate calcium. (Note: A common cause of hypoparathyroidism is accidental removal or damage during a thyroidectomy, which can lead to confusion between the two).",
    "additional": "Trousseau's Sign: This is another, more specific, sign of hypocalcemia. It is elicited by inflating a blood pressure cuff on the arm to a pressure higher than the systolic BP for 2-3 minutes.

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This question, while seemingly a cardiology question, has strong neurological undertones as it deals with vasospasm, a concept also seen in cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage. The core of the question is differentiating angina types.\n\n(c) Occurs same time each day, caused by coronary artery spasms: This is the correct definition of Prinzmetal's (or variant) angina. The underlying cause is not a fixed atherosclerotic blockage but a transient, severe spasm of a coronary artery. This spasm often occurs at rest (not with exertion) and frequently happens in a cyclical pattern, often at the same time each day (typically at night or early morning).\n\n(a) Occurs with known amount of activity...: This describes stable angina. The pain is predictable and brought on by a specific level of exertion or stress and is relieved by rest or nitroglycerin.\n\n(b) Occurs with increasing severity, pain is unpredictable: This describes unstable angina. The pattern of pain changes, occurring with less exertion or at rest, and is a medical emergency as it signals an impending myocardial infarction.\n\n(d) Always occur due to atherosclerotic lesion, pain increases with... activity: This is another description of stable angina.",
    "additional": "Key Differentiator: The primary difference between classic angina and Prinzmetal's angina is the cause: fixed plaque (atherosclerosis) vs. transient spasm. While patients with Prinzmetal's angina may also have underlying atherosclerosis, the spasm is the event that causes the chest pain.\n\nECG Findings: During an episode of Prinzmetal's angina, the ECG will show transient ST-segment elevation, which resolves once the spasm ceases. This is unlike unstable angina or NSTEMI, which typically shows ST depression or T-wave inversion.\n\nTreatment: The goal is to prevent and relieve coronary artery spasms. The mainstay of treatment is calcium channel blockers (e.g., nifedipine, diltiazem) and long-acting nitrates. Beta-blockers are generally avoided as they can potentially worsen spasms.\n\nNeurological Link (Cerebral Vasospasm): After a subarachnoid hemorrhage, a similar phenomenon called cerebral vasospasm can occur, where cerebral arteries spasm, leading to ischemia and stroke. This is also treated with calcium channel blockers (specifically nimodipine).\n\nPotential Future Questions: \"What class of medication is the primary treatment for Prinzmetal's angina?\" (Calcium channel blockers). \"What is the characteristic ECG finding during an episode of variant angina?\" (Transient ST elevation).\n\nSuggested Reference:\n\nBrunner & Suddarth's Textbook of Medical-Surgical Nursing, 14th Edition.

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "While this question is procedural and airway-related, it is fundamental to the care of any neurologically compromised patient who requires intubation. Verifying correct ET tube placement is a critical safety step.\n\n(c) Breath sounds are bilaterally equal: This is a primary clinical sign of correct placement. Auscultating for equal, clear breath sounds over both lung fields (apices and bases) confirms that the tube is in the trachea and ventilating both lungs. This should be combined with observing symmetrical chest rise.\n\n(a) Chest excursion is asymmetrical: This indicates a problem, most likely a right mainstem intubation. The right bronchus branches off at a less acute angle than the left, so an ET tube advanced too far will preferentially enter the right side, causing only the right chest to rise.\n\n(b) Air emerges from the endotracheal tube: Air will also emerge if the tube is in the esophagus, so this is not a conclusive sign of correct placement.\n\n(d) Breath sounds are auscultated over the epigastrium: Auscultating a gurgling sound over the stomach (epigastrium) while ventilating is a classic sign of esophageal intubation, meaning the tube is in the stomach instead of the trachea. This is a life-threatening misplacement and must be corrected immediately.",
    "additional": "Gold Standard for Confirmation: While bilateral breath sounds and chest rise are the first clinical checks, the single most reliable, or \"gold standard,\" method for confirming ET tube placement is end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2) detection (capnography). The presence of CO2 confirms that the tube is in the airway, as the stomach does not contain CO2.\n\nDefinitive Confirmation: The absolute definitive confirmation is a chest X-ray, which shows the tube's tip position, ideally 2-3 cm above the carina (the point where the trachea bifurcates).\n\nSteps for Confirmation (in order):\n\nObserve for symmetric chest rise and fall.\n\nAuscultate for presence of breath sounds bilaterally and absence of sounds over the epigastrium.\n\nCheck for condensation/vapor in the ET tube.\n\nConfirm with an ETCO2 detector (capnography).\n\nSecure the tube and obtain a chest X-ray.\n\nPotential Future Questions: \"What is the gold standard for immediate confirmation of ET tube placement?\" (End-tidal CO2 detector). \"What does asymmetrical chest rise after intubation indicate?\" (Right mainstem intubation).\n\nSuggested Reference:\n\nLewis's Medical-Surgical Nursing: Assessment and Management of Clinical Problems, 11th Edition.

    "explanation": "This is a paediatric neurology/developmental question. Temper tantrums are a normal part of development as a child seeks independence but lacks the verbal and emotional regulation skills to express their needs and frustrations.\n\n(c) Toddlers: This is the correct answer. The toddler stage (approximately 1 to 3 years) is the peak time for temper tantrums. This period is characterized by a drive for autonomy (\"I do it myself!\") clashing with limited physical and verbal abilities, leading to intense frustration that is expressed physically.\n\n(a) School age children (6-12 years): By this age, children have typically developed more advanced language and coping skills. Frequent temper tantrums in a school-age child may indicate an underlying emotional or behavioral issue.\n\n(b) Infancy (Birth to 1 year): Infants express distress through crying, not through the goal-oriented, frustrated outbursts characteristic of tantrums.\n\n(d) Preschool age children (3-5 years): While some tantrums may still occur, their frequency and intensity usually begin to decrease as the child's language skills and ability to understand rules improve.",

    "explanation": "Primitive reflexes, like the Moro reflex, are involuntary motor responses present in newborns that should disappear as the central nervous system matures. Their persistence is a key indicator of a neurological problem.\n\n(b) Brain damage: This is the correct answer. The Moro reflex (the \"startle\" reflex, where the baby throws out its arms and legs and then pulls them in when startled) should integrate and disappear by 4 to 6 months of age. Its persistence beyond this time frame is a \"red flag\" for neurological dysfunction, such as cerebral palsy or other forms of brain damage.\n\n(a) Immaturity: While the reflex is present in premature infants, persistence beyond the 6-month corrected age is abnormal and points to more than just immaturity.\n\n(c) Mental retardation: While children with brain damage may also have cognitive impairments (mental retardation), the persistence of a primitive reflex is a direct sign of a neurological motor control issue, not a cognitive one.\n\n(d) Brachial plexus palsy: A brachial plexus injury (e.g., Erb's palsy) would cause an asymmetric or absent Moro reflex on the affected side, not its persistence bilaterally.",

This includes monitoring the Level of Consciousness (LOC) using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), checking pupillary response, and assessing motor function. Early detection of changes is key to preventing irreversible brain damage.\n\nWhy (a) is incorrect: While elevating the head of the bed (HOB) to 30 degrees is correct, flexing the hips is contraindicated. Hip flexion increases intra-abdominal pressure, which in turn increases intrathoracic pressure and impedes venous drainage from the brain, thereby increasing ICP.\n\nWhy (b) is incorrect: Suctioning is only performed when necessary (PRN), not on a routine schedule. The act of suctioning can cause coughing and straining, which significantly raises ICP. If required, it must be done quickly (<10–15 seconds) and may involve pre-oxygenation.\n\nWhy (c) is incorrect: IV fluids are administered with extreme caution, often with an infusion pump, to prevent fluid overload, which can worsen cerebral edema and increase ICP. \"Routine\" administration is dangerous; fluids must be strictly monitored and often restricted.",

    "additional": "Neural Tube Defects (NTDs): These are birth defects of the brain, spine, or spinal cord that happen in the first month of pregnancy. The two most common are spina bifida and anencephaly.\n\nTypes of Spina Bifida:\n- Spina Bifida Occulta: The mildest form, a hidden defect with no opening on the back. Often asymptomatic.\n- Meningocele: The sac protrudes, but the spinal cord does not.\n- Meningomyelocele: The most severe form, with the spinal cord protruding into the sac.\n\nPrevention: The most significant preventive measure is the maternal intake of folic acid (a B vitamin) before conception and during the first trimester of pregnancy.\n\nPriority Nursing Care (Post-natal for Meningomyelocele):\n- Protect the sac from injury and infection. The infant is positioned prone (on the abdomen).\n- Cover the sac with a sterile, saline-soaked, non-adherent dressing.\n- Monitor for signs of increased ICP (hydrocephalus is a common comorbidity).\n- Perform regular neurologic assessments.\n\nBook Recommendation:\nWong's Nursing Care of Infants and Children - This pediatric textbook provides excellent, in-depth coverage of neural tube defects and their nursing management."

    "question": "With an overdose of barbiturates, death would most likely occur from:-",
    "options": {
      "A": "Kidney failure",
      "B": "Cardiac arrest",
      "C": "Respiratory depression",
      "D": "Cerebral haemorrhage"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Why (c) is correct: Barbiturates are powerful central nervous system (CNS) depressants. Their primary mechanism of action is to enhance the inhibitory effects of the neurotransmitter GABA. In an overdose, this CNS depression becomes profound, suppressing the respiratory center in the brainstem (medulla oblongata). This leads to progressively slower and shallower breathing (bradypnea and hypopnea), culminating in respiratory arrest and death.\n\nWhy (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect: While severe hypoxia from respiratory arrest will ultimately lead to cardiac arrest (b), the initial and direct cause of death is the cessation of breathing. Kidney failure (a) and cerebral hemorrhage (d) are not the primary, direct consequences of a barbiturate overdose.",
    "additional": "Clinical Use: Barbiturates (e.g., phenobarbital, thiopental) were once widely used as sedatives and hypnotics but have been largely replaced by safer benzodiazepines. They are still used as anticonvulsants and for induction of anesthesia.\n\nOverdose Management: The priority is always Airway, Breathing, Circulation (ABCs). Management includes intubation and mechanical ventilation to support breathing. There is no specific reversal agent (antidote) for barbiturate overdose, unlike opioids (naloxone) or benzodiazepines (flumazenil). Treatment is supportive.\n\nPossible Next Test Question: \"What is the priority nursing intervention for a patient with a suspected benzodiazepine overdose who is unresponsive?\" The answer would be to assess airway and breathing and prepare to administer Flumazenil (Romazicon).\n\nBook Recommendation:\nLehne's Pharmacology for Nursing Care - The chapter on sedative-hypnotics clearly explains the mechanism and dangers of barbiturates."

    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Why (b) is correct: The classic presentation of Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) is a rapidly ascending, symmetrical paralysis (weakness starting in the feet/legs and moving upwards). Areflexia (absence of reflexes) is another hallmark sign. While sensory changes can occur, the motor weakness is the dominant feature. The condition is an autoimmune attack on the myelin sheath of peripheral nerves, often triggered by a recent viral or bacterial infection.\n\nWhy (a) is incorrect: Peripheral neuropathy is a general term for nerve damage. While it causes weakness, it is typically not as rapidly progressive and ascending as described. A common cause is diabetes, which presents with a \"stocking-glove\" sensory loss first.\n\nWhy (c) is incorrect: Myasthenia gravis is characterized by fluctuating muscle weakness that worsens with activity and improves with rest. It typically affects the muscles of the eyes, face, and swallowing first (descending pattern), not an ascending paralysis from the legs.\n\nWhy (d) is incorrect: Radiculopathy is nerve root compression (e.g., a \"pinched nerve\"), which typically causes pain, numbness, and weakness in the specific distribution of that single nerve root, not a diffuse, symmetrical, ascending paralysis.",
    "additional": "Medical Emergency: GBS is a medical emergency because the ascending paralysis can reach the diaphragm and intercostal muscles, leading to respiratory failure.\n\nPriority Nursing Management:\n- Frequent and vigilant monitoring of respiratory status (respiratory rate, vital capacity, oxygen saturation).\n- Prepare for potential endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation.\n- Supportive care, including preventing complications of immobility (DVT, pressure sores).\n\nTreatment: The main treatments are Plasmapheresis (plasma exchange) or administration of Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg) to remove or neutralize the harmful antibodies attacking the nerves.\n\nBook Recommendation:\nBrunner & Suddarth's Textbook of Medical-Surgical Nursing - Provides a clear, detailed chapter on managing patients with peripheral nerve and neuromuscular disorders like GBS."

    "explanation": "Why (b) is correct: The symptoms described perfectly match the S1 nerve root dermatome and myotome. The S1 nerve root exits between the L5 and S1 vertebrae.\n\nSensory (Dermatome): The S1 dermatome covers the posterior thigh and leg (calf), and the lateral (outside) aspect of the heel, foot, and toes.\n\nMotor (Myotome): The S1 nerve root controls the muscles responsible for plantar flexion of the foot (pointing the toes down), which is the primary action used when 'walking on your toes.' Difficulty with this action points directly to S1 involvement.\n\nWhy (a) is incorrect: L5 nerve root compression (between L4-L5) typically causes weakness in dorsiflexion (lifting the foot and big toe up, leading to 'foot drop') and sensory changes on the top of the foot and the big toe.\n\nWhy (c) and (d) are incorrect: C5-C6 and C7-T1 are in the cervical spine.

    "explanation": "Why (d) is correct: An absence seizure, formerly known as a petit mal seizure, is precisely characterized by a brief, sudden lapse in consciousness. The person stops all activity and appears to be 'staring into space' or having a 'blank stare.' There is typically no motor activity, or only minor movements like eye blinking or lip-smacking. The episode ends as abruptly as it began, and the person has no memory of the event. They are most common in children.\n\nWhy (a) is incorrect: A myoclonic seizure involves sudden, brief, shock-like jerks of a muscle or group of muscles.\n\nWhy (b) is incorrect: A tonic seizure involves a sudden stiffening of the muscles.

In BDD, the individual has a debilitating preoccupation with a perceived or minor flaw in their physical appearance. This aligns with the older concept of Somatoform Disorders, which involve physical symptoms or concerns without a sufficient medical explanation.\n\nWhy (b) is incorrect: Conversion Disorder is a specific Somatoform Disorder where psychological stress is 'converted' into neurological symptoms (e.g., paralysis, blindness), which is different from BDD.\n\nWhy (c) is incorrect: Dissociative disorders involve memory, identity, or consciousness disruption.\n\nWhy (d) is incorrect: Personality disorders are long-standing patterns of maladaptive behavior (e.g., Antisocial, Borderline), not fixation on appearance.",

    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Why (c) is correct: Extra-Pyramidal Side Effects (EPS), such as dystonia, akathisia, and parkinsonism, are primarily caused by the blockade of Dopamine D2 receptors in the nigrostriatal pathway of the brain. Typical antipsychotics (like Haloperidol) have high D2 affinity, causing more EPS. Atypicals (like Olanzapine, Risperidone) block D2 more transiently and act more on serotonin (5-HT2A), leading to fewer EPS.\n\nWhy (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect: While other dopamine receptors like D3, D4, and D5 exist, they are less central to EPS. D2 antagonism in the nigrostriatal pathway is the main cause of motor side effects.",

  "question": "A patient presents with muscle weakness and fatigue. Upon further examination, it is revealed that the patient has decreased acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. Which of the following conditions is most likely responsible for this presentation?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Myasthenia gravis",
    "B": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)",
    "C": "Guillain-Barre syndrome",
    "D": "Muscular dystrophy"
  },
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "The correct answer is Myasthenia Gravis (MG). This is the classic definition of the disorder's pathophysiology. MG is an autoimmune disease where the body's own immune system produces antibodies that attack, block, or destroy acetylcholine (ACh) receptors on the muscle cell surface. This deficit of ACh receptors prevents the nerve impulse from being effectively transmitted to the muscle, resulting in muscle weakness that characteristically worsens with repetitive use and improves with rest.\n\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease affecting upper and lower motor neurons, not the receptors.\n\nGuillain-Barre syndrome is an autoimmune disorder where the immune system attacks the myelin sheath of peripheral nerves, leading to ascending paralysis.\n\nMuscular dystrophy is a group of genetic diseases that cause progressive weakness and loss of muscle mass due to defective muscle proteins.",
  "additional": "Key Manifestations of MG: Ptosis (drooping eyelids), diplopia (double vision), dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), dysarthria (slurred speech), and weakness in the limbs. Weakness is typically proximal (closer to the body's core).\n\nDiagnosis: The Tensilon (edrophonium chloride) test, where a short-acting anticholinesterase agent is given IV. A positive test results in a rapid, temporary improvement in muscle strength. Blood tests for acetylcholine receptor antibodies (AChR-Abs) are also definitive.\n\nNursing Priorities & Complications:\n\nMyasthenic Crisis: An acute exacerbation of muscle weakness, often triggered by infection, surgery, or inadequate medication. It can lead to respiratory failure, which is a medical emergency. The priority is maintaining a patent airway and providing respiratory support.\n\nCholinergic Crisis: Caused by an overdose of anticholinesterase medication. Symptoms also include severe muscle weakness, but are accompanied by signs of excessive cholinergic stimulation (SLUDGE: Salivation, Lacrimation, Urination, Diarrhea, GI cramping, Emesis) and bradycardia. The antidote is atropine.\n\nNursing Care: Administering medications (like Pyridostigmine) on a strict schedule, typically 30-60 minutes before meals to improve swallowing. Planning activities to conserve energy, and implementing aspiration precautions are crucial.\n\nREFERENCE BOOK:\n\nLewis's Medical-Surgical Nursing: Assessment and Management of Clinical Problems\n\nBrunner & Suddarth's Textbook of Medical-Surgical Nursing"

    "B": "Vegetative state",
    "C": "Minimally conscious state",
    "D": "Locked-in syndrome"

  "explanation": "A vegetative state is precisely defined as a condition of wakefulness without awareness. Patients may have sleep-wake cycles, open their eyes, and make non-purposeful movements, but they show no signs of conscious perception or meaningful interaction with their surroundings.\n\nComa: The patient is completely unresponsive and cannot be aroused. Eyes remain closed, and there are no sleep-wake cycles.\n\nMinimally conscious state: The patient demonstrates inconsistent but reproducible evidence of awareness, such as following simple commands, gesturing, or verbalizing.\n\nLocked-in syndrome: The patient is fully conscious and aware but is quadriplegic and unable to speak. Communication is often possible only through eye movements.",
  "additional": "Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS): This is the universal standard for assessing the level of consciousness in patients with brain injury. It assesses three areas:\n\nEye Opening (1-4 points)\n\nVerbal Response (1-5 points)\n\nMotor Response (1-6 points)\nA score of 15 is normal, while a score of 3 is the lowest possible. A score of 8 or less typically indicates a coma.\n\nNursing Priorities for Patients with Altered LOC:\n\nAirway, Breathing, Circulation (ABCs): The absolute priority is to maintain a patent airway.\n\nIncreased Intracranial Pressure (ICP): Monitor for signs of rising ICP (e.g., change in LOC, headache, pupillary changes, Cushing's Triad). Interventions include elevating the head of the bed to 30 degrees, maintaining head/neck alignment, and managing stimuli.\n\nSafety: Protecting the patient from injury (e.g., padded side rails).\n\nIntegumentary Care: Frequent repositioning to prevent pressure injuries.\n\nNutrition and Hydration: Providing enteral or parenteral nutrition.\n\nREFERENCE BOOK:\n\nLewis's Medical-Surgical Nursing: Assessment and Management of Clinical Problems"

  "question": "A patient with a spinal cord injury at the level of T6 presents with hypotension, bradycardia, and diaphoresis following a sudden change in position from supine to sitting. Which condition is the patient most likely experiencing?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Autonomic dysreflexia",
    "B": "Neurogenic shock",
    "C": "Spinal shock",
    "D": "Orthostatic hypotension"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Neurogenic shock is a type of distributive shock resulting from the loss or disruption of sympathetic nervous system tone, which occurs in spinal cord injuries at or above the T6 level. The loss of sympathetic tone leads to massive vasodilation, causing a sharp drop in blood pressure (hypotension), and unopposed vagal (parasympathetic) activity, which causes a slow heart rate (bradycardia). It is the only shock state that presents with bradycardia instead of tachycardia. While the trigger was a position change (suggesting orthostatic hypotension), the combination of hypotension and bradycardia is the classic sign of neurogenic shock in this patient population.\n\nAutonomic Dysreflexia: Occurs in patients with injuries at T6 or above but is characterized by an exaggerated sympathetic response to a noxious stimulus below the level of injury. It presents with severe, pounding headache and extreme hypertension, bradycardia (a reflex response), and flushing/sweating above the level of injury.\n\nSpinal Shock: A temporary condition following a spinal injury characterized by the complete loss of all reflex, motor, and sensory function below the level of the injury. It is not a circulatory shock.\n\nOrthostatic Hypotension: A drop in blood pressure upon standing, but the body's normal response is a compensatory increase in heart rate (tachycardia).",
  "additional": "Causes of Autonomic Dysreflexia: The most common cause is a distended bladder. Other causes include fecal impaction, tight clothing, or pressure injuries.\n\nNursing Priority for Autonomic Dysreflexia:\n\nSit the patient up immediately (High-Fowler's position) to help lower blood pressure via orthostasis.\n\nIdentify and remove the noxious stimulus: Check for bladder distention (kinked catheter, full bladder), check for bowel impaction, and loosen restrictive clothing.\n\nAdminister antihypertensives if ordered and if the hypertension persists after removing the stimulus.\n\nManagement of Neurogenic Shock: Focuses on restoring sympathetic tone and managing hemodynamics. This involves careful fluid resuscitation and the use of vasopressors (e.g., norepinephrine) to increase blood pressure and atropine to manage severe bradycardia.\n\nREFERENCE BOOK:\n\nBrunner & Suddarth's Textbook of Medical-Surgical Nursing"

    "B": "Intracerebral hemorrhage",
    "C": "Ischemic stroke",
    "D": "Subarachnoid hemorrhage"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "explanation": "The presentation of sudden-onset, unilateral neurological deficits (weakness, numbness) and language difficulties (aphasia, dysarthria) is characteristic of a stroke. The imaging finding of an \"acute infarction\" confirms that tissue death has occurred due to a lack of blood supply, which defines an ischemic stroke. The left middle cerebral artery (MCA) is the most common vessel involved in strokes and supplies the areas of the brain responsible for motor/sensory function of the contralateral side and language centers (in most right-handed individuals).\n\nTransient Ischemic Attack (TIA): Presents with the same symptoms as a stroke, but they are temporary and resolve completely, typically within an hour, without evidence of infarction on imaging.\n\nIntracerebral Hemorrhage & Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: These are hemorrhagic strokes (caused by bleeding), not infarction (caused by a blockage).

The shuffling gait, stooped posture, and masked (expressionless) facies are also classic features resulting from the underlying bradykinesia and rigidity. The cause is the degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra of the brain.\n\nAlzheimer's disease: Primarily a cognitive disorder characterized by memory loss and impaired judgment.\n\nMultiple sclerosis (MS): An autoimmune demyelinating disease with varied symptoms like visual disturbances, spasticity, fatigue, and sensory changes, often with a relapsing-remitting course.\n\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS): A motor neuron disease causing progressive muscle weakness, atrophy, and spasticity, eventually leading to paralysis.",

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The priority in any trauma patient with a suspected head injury is to assume a concurrent cervical spine injury until proven otherwise. Maintaining cervical spine immobilization (using hands-on stabilization, a cervical collar, and a backboard) is the most critical action to prevent further spinal cord damage. While assessing pupils (D) is an important part of the neurological exam, it does not take precedence over preventing a catastrophic secondary injury. Applying direct pressure (A) should be done with caution over a potential skull fracture, and aspirin (B) is contraindicated as it increases bleeding risk.",

    "question": "What is the appropriate management for a conscious patient experiencing a seizure?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Restrain the patient to prevent injury.",
      "B": "Place the patient in a supine position.",
      "C": "Protect the patient from injury, clear the area, and monitor the duration of the seizure.",
      "D": "Administer antiepileptic medication immediately."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The absolute priority during an active seizure is patient safety. This involves protecting the patient from their environment. You should guide the patient to the floor if standing, move nearby objects away, and place something soft under their head. Restraining the patient (A) is contraindicated as it can cause musculoskeletal injury. Administering medication (D) is not a first aid measure and is typically reserved for prolonged seizures (status epilepticus) in a hospital setting. After the seizure, the patient should be placed in the recovery position (on their side) to maintain a patent airway and prevent aspiration.",
    "additional": "Seizure Precautions:\n- Oxygen and suction at bedside\n- Maintain IV access\n- Padded side rails\n- Bed in lowest position\n\nPost-Seizure Documentation:\n- Onset time, duration\n- Seizure type and body parts involved\n- LOC\n- Postictal state\n\nStatus Epilepticus:\n- Seizure >5 min or repeated seizures without full recovery in between\n- Emergency: Treat with IV benzodiazepines (e.g., lorazepam)\n\nREFERENCE BOOK:\n- Brunner & Suddarth's Textbook of Medical-Surgical Nursing"

    "question": "A patient presents with sudden-onset severe headache, vomiting, and altered mental status. Imaging reveals a berry-shaped aneurysm at the junction of the anterior communicating artery and anterior cerebral artery. Which of the following neurological conditions is most likely responsible for these symptoms?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Ischemic stroke",
      "B": "Intracerebral hemorrhage",
      "C": "Subdural hematoma",
      "D": "Subarachnoid hemorrhage"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The rupture of a cerebral aneurysm, often called a \"berry\" aneurysm due to its shape, is the most common cause of a non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). This condition involves bleeding into the subarachnoid space (the space between the arachnoid and pia mater layers of the meninges). The classic presentation is a sudden, explosive \"thunderclap\" headache, often described as \"the worst headache of my life,\" accompanied by signs of meningeal irritation (nuchal rigidity, photophobia) and increased intracranial pressure (vomiting, altered LOC).",
    "additional": "Complications:\n- Rebleeding (high risk in first 24 hrs)\n- Cerebral vasospasm (3–14 days post-bleed): Prevented with nimodipine\n- Hydrocephalus: Blood blocks CSF reabsorption\n\nNursing Priorities:\n- Quiet environment\n- Strict BP control\n- Nimodipine administration\n- Frequent neuro checks\n- Seizure precautions\n\nREFERENCE BOOK:\n- Lewis's Medical-Surgical Nursing"

    "question": "A patient presents with sudden-onset unilateral facial droop, arm weakness, and slurred speech. Symptoms began approximately 30 minutes ago but have partially resolved since then. Which of the following neurological conditions is most likely responsible for these symptoms?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Transient ischemic attack (TIA)",
      "B": "Ischemic stroke",
      "C": "Hemorrhagic stroke",
      "D": "Intracerebral hemorrhage"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a temporary episode of neurological dysfunction caused by focal brain ischemia, without acute infarction (tissue death). The symptoms are identical to those of an ischemic stroke but are transient and resolve completely, usually within an hour. The fact that the symptoms have begun to resolve is the key feature that points to a TIA rather than a completed ischemic stroke.",
    "additional": "TIA = Warning Sign:\n- 1/3 of TIA patients will have a major stroke within a year\n\nPost-TIA Management:\n- Antiplatelets (aspirin, clopidogrel)\n- Statins\n- BP control\n- Lifestyle: Smoking cessation, diet, activity\n\nDiagnostics:\n- Carotid ultrasound\n- Echocardiogram\n- MRI brain\n\nREFERENCE BOOK:\n- Brunner & Suddarth's Textbook of Medical-Surgical Nursing"

      "B": "Vestibular neuritis",
      "C": "Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV)",
      "D": "Labyrinthitis"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "BPPV is the most common cause of vertigo. It is characterized by brief (usually <1 minute), recurrent episodes of intense vertigo that are specifically triggered by changes in head position (e.g., rolling over in bed, looking up). It is caused by the displacement of small calcium carbonate crystals (otoconia) into the semicircular canals of the inner ear.",
    "additional": "Differentials:\n- Vestibular neuritis: persistent vertigo\n- Labyrinthitis: vertigo + hearing loss\n- Ménière’s: vertigo (lasting hours), tinnitus, hearing loss\n\nDiagnosis:\n- Dix-Hallpike maneuver\n\nTreatment:\n- Epley maneuver (canalith repositioning)\n- Fall precautions\n\nREFERENCE BOOK:\n- Lewis's Medical-Surgical Nursing"

      "B": "Alzheimer's disease",
      "C": "Huntington's disease",
      "D": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia. It is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a gradual decline in cognitive function, starting with short-term memory loss (amnesia) and progressing to affect language (aphasia), motor skills (apraxia), and recognition (agnosia). Impaired judgment and personality changes are also early features. The description of a slow, progressive decline in multiple cognitive and functional domains is the hallmark of Alzheimer's.",

      "B": "Cluster headache",
      "C": "Tension-type headache",
      "D": "Chronic daily headache"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This is the classic presentation of a migraine with aura. Key features include a severe, unilateral, throbbing or pulsating headache that is often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia (sensitivity to light), and phonophobia (sensitivity to sound). An aura is a transient neurological symptom (often visual, like flashing lights or zigzag lines) that precedes or accompanies the headache.",

    "question": "A patient presents with gradual-onset weakness, spasticity, hyperreflexia, and positive Babinski sign. Imaging reveals demyelinating plaques in the white matter of the brain and spinal cord. Which of the following neurological conditions is most likely responsible for these symptoms?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)",
      "B": "Multiple sclerosis (MS)",
      "C": "Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS)",
      "D": "Myasthenia gravis"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune inflammatory disease in which the immune system attacks and damages the myelin sheath of nerve cells in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). This demyelination disrupts nerve impulse transmission. The presence of demyelinating plaques on imaging is the pathological hallmark of MS. The clinical signs of spasticity, hyperreflexia, and a positive Babinski sign are classic upper motor neuron (UMN) signs, which are characteristic of MS.",
    "additional": "Common Symptoms:\n- Fatigue, vision changes, paresthesias, spasticity\n- Cognitive impairment, bladder issues\n\nTreatment:\n- DMTs: Interferon-beta, glatiramer\n- Symptom control: Baclofen (spasticity), rest scheduling (fatigue)\n- Fall precautions, assistive device education\n\nREFERENCE BOOK:\n- Brunner & Suddarth's Textbook of Medical-Surgical Nursing"

Over time, the patient develops dysphagia and dysarthria. Which of the following neurological conditions is most likely responsible for these symptoms?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Parkinson's disease",
      "B": "Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS)",
      "C": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)",
      "D": "Myasthenia gravis"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a rapidly progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease that affects both upper motor neurons (in the brain) and lower motor neurons (in the spinal cord). This leads to a combination of UMN signs (spasticity, hyperreflexia) and LMN signs (muscle weakness, atrophy, and fasciculations - muscle twitching). The disease relentlessly progresses, leading to difficulty speaking (dysarthria), swallowing (dysphagia), and eventually breathing, as the respiratory muscles become paralyzed. Cognitive function typically remains intact.",
    "additional": "Respiratory Management:\n- Monitor vital capacity\n- Non-invasive or invasive ventilation (BiPAP or tracheostomy)\n\nNutrition:\n- PEG tube for dysphagia\n\nMedications:\n- Riluzole (slows progression modestly)\n\nPalliative Care:\n- Early integration for symptom control and end-of-life planning\n\nREFERENCE BOOK:\n- Lewis's Medical-Surgical Nursing"
