      "C": "Fetus responds to sound, eyelids close",
      "D": "Finger nails can be seen, gender determined"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This period marks the end of the embryonic stage and the beginning of the fetal stage, a time of rapid growth and differentiation.\n\nBy 12 weeks gestation:\n- All major organ systems are formed.\n- Fingers and toes are distinct, and fingernails and toenails begin to develop.\n- The external genitalia have formed to the point where the gender can be determined via ultrasound.\n- The fetal heart has been beating for weeks, but it is not typically heard with a standard stethoscope yet.\n\nAnalyzing the Other Options:\n(a) The fetal heart is heard with a Doppler ultrasound around 10–12 weeks, but not usually with a fetoscope/stethoscope until ~20 weeks. Vernix caseosa appears around 18–20 weeks.\n(b) Lanugo appears ~16–20 weeks. Swallowing begins ~12–14 weeks, so partially correct but less accurate than (d).\n(c) Eyelids fuse shut around 10 weeks and reopen at ~26–28 weeks. Response to sound begins ~18–20 weeks.",

      "C": "36th - 40th week.",
      "D": "32nd - 34th week."
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Hemodilution is due to a 40–50% increase in plasma volume vs. only 20–30% RBC mass increase.\n\nPeak occurs at 32–34 weeks, when plasma volume is highest relative to RBCs, leading to physiological anemia. Later, RBC production increases more, slightly improving Hgb.\n\nIron supplementation is essential to prevent true iron deficiency anemia.",

      "A": "Sponteneous abortion.",
      "B": "Result in thrush in the newborn",
      "C": "Cause opthalmia neonatorum",
      "D": "Increase the risk ofacquired Immune deficiency syndrome"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "A gonococcal infection (Neisseria gonorrhoeae) during pregnancy poses risks to both the mother and the fetus/pregnancy.\n\nRisk to the Pregnancy: In the first trimester (8 weeks), an untreated sexually transmitted infection like gonorrhea or chlamydia can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). The inflammation and infection of the reproductive tract can increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy and spontaneous abortion (miscarriage).\n\nRisk to the Newborn: Option (c) Cause ophthalmia neonatorum is also a very significant consequence. If the mother has an active infection at the time of delivery, the bacteria can be transmitted to the baby's eyes during passage through the birth canal. This causes a severe conjunctivitis that can rapidly lead to corneal ulceration and permanent blindness if not treated promptly. This is the primary reason why prophylactic antibiotic eye ointment is given to all newborns.\n\nChoosing the Best Answer: The question asks for the risk to the pregnancy at 8 weeks. At this early stage, the most immediate threat to the continuation of the pregnancy is spontaneous abortion. Ophthalmia neonatorum is a risk to the neonate after birth. Therefore, (a) is the most accurate answer for the specific timing given.",
    "additional": "Other Risks: PROM, preterm birth, chorioamnionitis.\nScreening: Routine STI screening in first prenatal visit.\nTreatment: Ceftriaxone injection. Partner must be treated.\nCo-infection: Often occurs with chlamydia, hence dual therapy is given.\nTextbook Reference: Lowdermilk, D. L., et al. (2016). Maternity & Women's Health Care.

      "D": "Administration of immune globulin before conception and within seventy-two (72) hours after birth,"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "If an Rh-negative mother carries an Rh-positive fetus, there is a risk of Rh isoimmunization. Fetal RBCs may enter the maternal circulation (e.g., during delivery or trauma), causing the mother to form antibodies that can harm future pregnancies.\n\nRhoGAM (anti-D Ig) prevents sensitization by destroying Rh+ cells before the maternal immune system reacts.\n\nStandard Protocol:\n- 28 weeks gestation: Prophylactic RhoGAM is given.\n- Within 72 hours postpartum: Another dose is administered **if** the baby is Rh+.\n\nAlso given after abortion, amniocentesis, or abdominal trauma.",
    "additional": "Screening: Blood type & antibody screen (indirect Coombs) in early pregnancy.\nCoombs Testing:\n- Indirect: Checks mother's blood for anti-Rh antibodies.\n- Direct: Performed on newborn cord blood to check if antibodies are bound to RBCs.\nTextbook Reference: Leifer, G.

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This question describes assessing fetal station (descent) using abdominal palpation, specifically the 'rule of fifths.'\n\nRule of Fifths: Assesses how much of the fetal head is palpable above the symphysis pubis.\n- 5/5 Palpable: Head not engaged.\n- 2/5 Palpable: Head is engaged; only 2/5 of the head is felt.\n\nInterpretation: 'Sinciput is felt and occiput just felt' suggests deep engagement. Therefore, 2/5 is correct.",

Therefore, close fetal surveillance is crucial, especially in the third trimester.\n\nFetal Movement Counting (\"Kick Counts\"): This is a simple, non-invasive method for the mother to monitor her baby's well-being. The mother is instructed to start monitoring her baby's movements daily from around 28 weeks. A common instruction is to count the number of movements in a 1–2 hour period at the same time each day. A decrease in fetal movement is a potential warning sign of fetal distress and requires immediate follow-up. Option (a) is the best choice, assuming \"weekly\" is a typo for \"daily.\"",

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Gestational Trophoblastic Disease (GTD) is a spectrum of tumors arising from placental tissue. The most common form is a hydatidiform mole (\"molar pregnancy\").\n\nImmediate Management:\n\nEvacuation of the Uterus: The first and most critical step is to remove the molar tissue from the uterus. The standard procedure is suction curettage (also called suction evacuation). \"Excavation\" is an unusual term but means the same thing.\n\nControl of Bleeding: The uterus may not contract well after evacuation, and there is a high risk of hemorrhage. Management is similar to PPH (oxytocin, uterine massage).\n\nSubsequent Management (Follow-up):\n\nhCG Monitoring: After evacuation, serum hCG levels are monitored weekly until they return to zero and remain there for three consecutive weeks, then monthly for 6–12 months. Persistently high or rising hCG levels indicate persistent GTD, which is a malignant form of the disease.\n\nMethotrexate: If persistent GTD is diagnosed, chemotherapy with methotrexate is the standard treatment.",
    "additional": "Analyzing the Options:\n\n(a) This option includes the key steps. Although methotrexate is for follow-up, it is a critical part of the overall management plan.\n\n(b, c) Family planning is crucial (the woman must avoid pregnancy for a year to allow for accurate hCG monitoring), but it is part of the follow-up plan, not the immediate management.\n\n(d) \"ariti D\" is likely a typo for Anti-D (RhoGAM). It would be given if the woman is Rh-negative, but it is not a universal part of management for all patients. Option (a) is more comprehensive.\n\nSigns of Molar Pregnancy:\n- Vaginal bleeding (often dark brown \"prune juice\" discharge)\n- Uterine size larger than expected for gestational age\n- Markedly elevated serum hCG levels\n- Hyperemesis gravidarum (severe nausea/vomiting) due to high hCG\n- Early development of preeclampsia (before 20 weeks)\n- Passage of grape-like vesicles\n\nTextbook Reference: Lowdermilk, D.

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is the involuntary leakage of urine during activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure, such as coughing, sneezing, laughing, or lifting.\n\nCause in Postpartum Women: It is very common after childbirth due to the stretching and weakening of the pelvic floor muscles and supporting ligaments during pregnancy and delivery.\n\nFirst-Line Management: The primary, most effective, and least invasive treatment is to strengthen these muscles. This is achieved through pelvic floor muscle exercises, commonly known as Kegel exercises. Regular and correctly performed Kegels can significantly improve or resolve SUI.",
    "additional": "Analyzing Other Options:\n\n(a, c) Rest and ambulation are important for general recovery but do not specifically address the muscle weakness causing SUI.\n\n(d) Reducing fluid intake is incorrect and harmful advice. It can lead to dehydration and concentrated urine, which can irritate the bladder and increase the risk of UTIs, potentially worsening incontinence symptoms.\n\nTeaching Kegel Exercises:\n- Identify the muscles: Instruct the woman to try to stop the flow of urine midstream. Those are the muscles to target (but she should not do this regularly as it can interfere with bladder emptying).\n- Technique: Contract the muscles as if stopping urination and holding back gas. Hold the contraction for 5–10 seconds, then relax for 10 seconds.\n- Repetitions: Work up to performing 10–15 repetitions, 3 times a day.\n\nImprovement takes 6–12 weeks.\n\nOther Types of Incontinence:\n- Urge Incontinence: Sudden, intense urge to urinate, followed by leakage.\n- Overflow Incontinence: Constant dribbling from a full bladder that can't empty.\n\nTextbook Reference: Lewis's Medical-Surgical Nursing: Assessment and Management of Clinical Problems, Chapter 45: Nursing Management: Renal and Urologic Problems."
