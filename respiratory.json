      "A": "Reduce client’s anxiety",
      "B": "Maintain adequate oxygenation",
      "C": "Decrease chest pain",
      "D": "Maintain adequate circulating volume"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "In any trauma situation, especially one involving the chest, the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) are the absolute priority. The patient's injury (blunt chest trauma from a steering wheel) puts him at high risk for conditions that severely compromise breathing and oxygenation, such as pneumothorax, hemothorax, flail chest, or pulmonary contusion. Any of these can lead to hypoxia and respiratory failure. Therefore, ensuring adequate oxygenation is the most critical, life-sustaining goal.",
    "additional": "Reducing anxiety is important but secondary to oxygenation. Chest pain should be treated, but only to support oxygenation. Circulating volume becomes a priority if hemorrhage is suspected. Key trauma conditions: pneumothorax, hemothorax, flail chest, tension pneumothorax. Nursing interventions: Administer high-flow O2, assess breathing, insert chest tube if needed. NCK may test priority symptoms like absent breath sounds or tracheal deviation.

    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "A pneumothorax is a condition where air accumulates in the pleural space between the lung and the chest wall. This collection of air increases the pressure on the lung, causing it to collapse (partially or fully). When the lung is collapsed, no air is moving in or out of that area. Therefore, when you auscultate over the affected region, you will hear diminished or completely absent breath sounds. This is the classic, hallmark sign of a pneumothorax.",
    "additional": "Wheezing = narrowed airways (e.g., asthma); dullness = fluid (e.g., hemothorax); crackles = fluid in alveoli (e.g., pneumonia, heart failure). NCK may test matching assessment findings to respiratory diagnoses. Treatment: chest tube insertion.

      "D": "Position the patient in dorsal recumbent position to enhance ventilation"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Patients with COPD have chronic lung inflammation and damage, making them extremely vulnerable to respiratory infections. An infection like influenza or pneumonia can cause a severe exacerbation of their COPD, leading to respiratory failure, hospitalization, and even death. Therefore, a cornerstone of COPD management and prevention of exacerbations is to strongly recommend and facilitate annual influenza vaccination and pneumococcal vaccination. This is a key public health and preventative nursing intervention.",
    "additional": "High-flow O2 may suppress the hypoxic drive in CO2-retainers. Bronchodilators are a primary treatment. Dorsal recumbent positioning worsens ventilation; instead, use high Fowler's or tripod position. COPD management: smoking cessation, bronchodilators (LABA, LAMA), corticosteroids, vaccines, pulmonary rehab, oxygen therapy, and breathing techniques like pursed-lip breathing. NCK may test education, safety, and positioning. Reference: Brunner & Suddarth, 14th Ed., Ch. 24."

      "C": "Demonstrating exercises to increase vital capacity",
      "D": "Encouraging participation in activities such as jogging"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Chronic respiratory acidosis is caused by the retention of carbon dioxide (CO2) due to inadequate ventilation, a hallmark of diseases like COPD. The primary goal of management is to improve ventilation to blow off excess CO2. Exercises designed to strengthen respiratory muscles and improve lung function, such as pursed-lip breathing and diaphragmatic (abdominal) breathing, are crucial components of pulmonary rehabilitation. These exercises help improve the efficiency of breathing, reduce the work of breathing, and can increase vital capacity over time, directly addressing the root cause of the acidosis.",
    "additional": "Planning increased activity is vague; pacing and bronchodilators are more appropriate. Diet: low-carb but NOT low-protein—protein is critical for respiratory muscles. Jogging is too strenuous. ABGs in compensated chronic respiratory acidosis: near-normal pH, high PaCO2, high HCO3. Education includes breathing techniques, energy conservation, nutrition, hydration.

    "explanation": "A thoracentesis is a procedure to remove fluid or air from the pleural space. While its primary purpose is often diagnostic or therapeutic, it also allows for the instillation of medications such as in pleurodesis. In pleurodesis, a sclerosing agent (like talc or doxycycline) is instilled to cause inflammation and adhesion between the visceral and parietal pleura, obliterating the pleural space to prevent recurrent effusions.",

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Laryngeal cancer is strongly linked to inhaled carcinogens that directly damage the cells of the larynx. Tobacco is the leading cause. Asbestos is an occupational carcinogen that significantly increases risk. Tar products from tobacco and industrial exposure also contribute to malignancy.",
    "additional": "Chronic laryngitis and voice strain do not directly cause cancer. High-fiber diet is protective.

      "C": "Decrease chest pain",
      "D": "Maintain adequate circulating volume"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Background: The patient has sustained significant blunt chest trauma. This mechanism of injury puts him at high risk for life-threatening conditions like pneumothorax, hemothorax, flail chest, and pulmonary contusion, all of which compromise breathing and gas exchange.\n\n(B) Why it's correct: According to the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) of emergency care, maintaining a patent airway and ensuring adequate breathing and oxygenation is the highest priority. The severe pain from the injury will cause the patient to splint (take shallow breaths), which can lead to atelectasis and hypoxia. The underlying injury itself (like a pneumothorax) directly impairs oxygenation. Therefore, all initial interventions will be aimed at ensuring the patient is breathing effectively and is well-oxygenated.\n\n(C) Why it's incorrect: While decreasing chest pain is very important (as it helps improve breathing), it is a means to an end. The ultimate goal is adequate oxygenation. Pain management is an intervention to achieve the goal of better breathing.\n\n(A) Why it's incorrect: Reducing anxiety is also important, but it is a psychosocial need that comes after the life-sustaining physiological needs of breathing and circulation are addressed.\n\n(D) Why it's incorrect: Maintaining circulating volume (Circulation) is the 'C' in ABCs. It is also a very high priority. However, in the immediate context of a chest injury where the primary complaint is chest pain and the mechanism affects the lungs, \"Breathing\" and \"Oxygenation\" are typically addressed first, unless there are obvious signs of massive hemorrhage and shock (like hypotension and extreme tachycardia).",
    "additional": "Signs of Respiratory Distress: Tachypnea (rapid breathing), use of accessory muscles, nasal flaring, cyanosis, paradoxical chest movement (in flail chest), decreased or absent breath sounds, tracheal deviation (in tension pneumothorax).\n\nInitial Interventions: Administer high-flow oxygen, establish IV access, place the patient on a cardiac monitor and pulse oximeter, and prepare for a chest X-ray and potential chest tube insertion.\n\nTextbook Reference: Lewis's Medical-Surgical Nursing, 11th Ed. - Chapter 27 (Chest and Lower Respiratory Problems).

      "D": "pronounced crackles"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "(A) Why it's correct: A pneumothorax is a collection of air in the pleural space, which causes the lung to collapse. Since air is no longer moving in and out of the collapsed portion of the lung, there will be diminished or completely absent breath sounds on auscultation over the affected area. The chest on the affected side will also be hyperresonant to percussion because the pleural space is filled with air.\n\n(B) Why it's incorrect: Wheezing is a high-pitched whistling sound caused by the narrowing of airways. It is a hallmark of asthma and can be seen in COPD or bronchitis, but not typically in a pneumothorax.\n\n(C) Why it's incorrect: Dullness on percussion indicates the presence of fluid or solid tissue. This finding would be expected in a hemothorax (blood in the pleural space), pneumonia (consolidation), or pleural effusion (fluid buildup), but not a pneumothorax.\n\n(D) Why it's incorrect: Crackles (or rales) are clicking or rattling sounds caused by the \"popping open\" of small airways and alveoli collapsed by fluid. They are characteristic of pulmonary edema, pneumonia, and atelectasis.",
    "additional": "Tension Pneumothorax: This is a life-threatening emergency where air enters the pleural space on inspiration but cannot escape on expiration. The trapped air builds up pressure, collapsing the lung and pushing the mediastinum (heart, great vessels, trachea) to the opposite side. Key signs are severe respiratory distress, hypotension, jugular vein distention (JVD), and tracheal deviation away from the affected side. It requires immediate needle decompression followed by chest tube insertion.\n\nTextbook Reference: Lewis's Medical-Surgical Nursing, 11th Ed. - Chapter 27 (Chest and Lower Respiratory Problems).

      "D": "Position the patient in dorsal recumbent position to enhance ventilation"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "(B) Why it's correct: Patients with COPD have compromised lung function and are at extremely high risk for complications from respiratory infections. An infection like influenza or pneumonia can trigger a severe, life-threatening exacerbation. Therefore, a cornerstone of long-term COPD management is prevention, which includes annual flu shots and the pneumococcal vaccine.\n\n(A) Why it's incorrect: This is a classic and dangerous mistake. For a small subset of COPD patients (those who are chronic CO2 retainers), their primary respiratory drive is a low level of oxygen in the blood (hypoxic drive). Administering high-flow oxygen can suppress this drive, leading to respiratory depression and arrest. Therefore, oxygen for these patients is carefully titrated to the lowest effective dose to maintain a target SpO2, typically 88-92%. Note: In an acute emergency, high-flow oxygen is given, but it is quickly titrated down once the patient is stable.\n\n(C) Why it's incorrect: Prophylactic (maintenance) bronchodilators are the mainstay of COPD treatment. Medications like long-acting beta-agonists (LABA) and long-acting musinic antagonists (LAMA) are used daily to keep airways open and prevent exacerbations.\n\n(D) Why it's incorrect: The dorsal recumbent (supine) position is the worst position for a patient with breathing difficulties. It allows the abdominal organs to push up on the diaphragm, decreasing lung expansion. The best position is the upright or tripod position (sitting up and leaning forward with arms supported), which maximizes chest expansion.",
    "additional": "COPD Management: Key aspects include smoking cessation, bronchodilator therapy, corticosteroid therapy (especially during exacerbations), oxygen therapy, and pulmonary rehabilitation.\n\nPursed-Lip Breathing: Teach patients this technique to prolong exhalation, prevent airway collapse, and help empty trapped air.\n\nTextbook Reference: Lewis's Medical-Surgical Nursing, 11th Ed. - Chapter 28 (Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases).

      "D": "Old age, heart failure and intestinal obstruction clients are more prone"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "(B) Why it's correct: A pulmonary embolism (PE) is, by definition, the blockage of a pulmonary artery or one of its branches. The embolus (blockage) is most often a blood clot (thrombus) that has traveled from a deep vein in the legs or pelvis (deep vein thrombosis or DVT). However, the embolus can also be fat (from a long bone fracture), air (from improper IV line management), amniotic fluid, or septic vegetation. The key location of the obstruction is the pulmonary arterial circulation.\n\n(A) Why it's incorrect: The pulmonary veins carry oxygenated blood from the lungs back to the left atrium. A clot here would be a systemic embolus, not a pulmonary embolus. A PE involves the pulmonary arteries, which carry deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle to the lungs.\n\n(C) Why it's incorrect: While trauma and pregnancy are indeed major risk factors for DVT and subsequent PE, the Valsalva maneuver is not. The Valsalva maneuver (straining against a closed glottis) increases intrathoracic pressure and can cause bradycardia; it is not a primary cause of PE.\n\n(D) Why it's incorrect: While old age and heart failure are risk factors, intestinal obstruction is not a classic predisposing factor for PE. The major risk factors are summarized by Virchow's Triad.",
    "additional": "Virchow's Triad (The three factors predisposing to DVT/PE):\n\nVenous Stasis: Immobility, prolonged bed rest, long-distance travel, obesity, heart failure.\n\nEndothelial (Vessel Wall) Injury: Trauma, surgery (especially orthopedic), IV catheters.\n\nHypercoagulability: Dehydration, cancer, pregnancy, oral contraceptive use, inherited clotting disorders.\n\nSigns & Symptoms of PE: The classic triad is dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, and hemoptysis, but this is rarely seen. The most common symptom is unexplained, sudden-onset dyspnea. Other signs include tachycardia, tachypnea, cough, and anxiety. A massive PE can cause hypotension and cardiogenic shock.\n\nDiagnosis: A CT Angiogram (CTA) of the chest is the gold standard diagnostic test.\n\nTextbook Reference: Lewis's Medical-Surgical Nursing, 11th Ed. - Chapter 27 (Chest and Lower Respiratory Problems).

    "question": "Which of the most relevant knowledge about oxygen administration to a client with COPD",
    "options": {
      "A": "Oxygen at 1-2L/min is given to maintain the hypoxic stimulus for breathing.",
      "B": "Hypoxia stimulates the central chemoreceptors in the medulla that makes the client breath.",
      "C": "Oxygen is administered best using non-rebreathing mask.",
      "D": "Blood gases are monitored using a pulse oximeter."
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "(A) Why it's correct: This statement accurately reflects the principle of the hypoxic drive. In some patients with chronic CO2 retention, the central chemoreceptors become desensitized to high CO2 levels. Their primary stimulus to breathe becomes peripheral chemoreceptors, which are sensitive to hypoxemia (low PaO2). Giving low-flow oxygen (e.g., 1-2 L/min via nasal cannula) can improve oxygenation without \"knocking out\" this hypoxic drive. The goal is to correct the dangerous hypoxemia while preserving the stimulus to breathe.\n\n(B) Why it's incorrect: The central chemoreceptors (in the medulla) are stimulated by high levels of CO2 (or H+ ions) in the cerebrospinal fluid. The peripheral chemoreceptors (in the carotid and aortic bodies) are stimulated by hypoxia. This statement incorrectly links hypoxia to the central chemoreceptors.\n\n(C) Why it's incorrect: A non-rebreathing mask delivers a high concentration of oxygen (FiO2 > 60%). This is generally contraindicated for routine oxygen administration in a patient with COPD due to the risk of suppressing the hypoxic drive. The preferred method for stable COPD patients is a low-flow device like a nasal cannula or a high-flow device that allows for precise, lower FiO2 delivery, such as a Venturi mask.\n\n(D) Why it's incorrect: A pulse oximeter measures oxygen saturation (SpO2), not blood gases. An Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) analysis is the test that measures PaO2, PaCO2, pH, and bicarbonate, providing a complete picture of the patient's gas exchange and acid-base status.",
    "additional": "Oxygen Delivery Devices:\n\nNasal Cannula: Low flow (1-6 L/min).\n\nSimple Face Mask: Medium flow (6-12 L/min).\n\nNon-rebreather Mask: High concentration (10-15 L/min).\n\nVenturi Mask: Delivers a precise, fixed concentration of oxygen, making it ideal for COPD patients.\n\nTextbook Reference: Lewis's Medical-Surgical Nursing, 11th Ed. - Chapter 28 (Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases).

      "D": "Encouraging participation in activities such as jogging"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "(C) Why it's correct: Exercises that increase vital capacity, such as pursed-lip breathing and diaphragmatic (abdominal) breathing, are crucial for patients with chronic respiratory acidosis. These techniques help to slow the respiratory rate, prevent small airway collapse during exhalation, and allow for more complete emptying of the lungs, which improves gas exchange and reduces CO2 retention. Pulmonary rehabilitation programs are centered on these types of exercises.\n\n(A) Why it's incorrect: The goal is not just to plan for activity, but to improve the ability to do the activity. The focus should be on building tolerance through specific breathing and conditioning exercises.\n\n(B) Why it's incorrect: The recommended diet for a patient with severe COPD is often a high-calorie, high-protein diet to prevent malnutrition and muscle wasting. Carbohydrate metabolism produces more CO2 than fat or protein metabolism, so a diet lower in carbohydrates and higher in fat can sometimes be beneficial to reduce the CO2 load, but a low-protein diet is contraindicated.\n\n(D) Why it's incorrect: Jogging is a high-impact, high-intensity aerobic activity that would likely be impossible and dangerous for a client with significant chronic respiratory acidosis and COPD. Exercise should be low-impact and carefully paced, such as walking.",
    "additional": "Diaphragmatic Breathing: Teach the patient to place one hand on their chest and the other on their abdomen.

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "(C) Why it's correct: While the primary purpose is usually fluid removal, a thoracentesis also provides a direct route to instill medications into the pleural space. This procedure, known as pleurodesis, involves instilling a sclerosing (scarring) agent like talc or doxycycline. This causes the two layers of the pleura to adhere to each other, obliterating the pleural space and preventing the re-accumulation of fluid or air. This is often done for patients with recurrent malignant pleural effusions or persistent pneumothorax.\n\n(A) Why it's incorrect: The peritoneal space is in the abdomen. A procedure to aspirate fluid from the peritoneal space is called a paracentesis.\n\n(B) Why it's incorrect: A thoracentesis is an invasive procedure that carries risks, including pneumothorax, bleeding, and infection. Therefore, informed consent is absolutely necessary.\n\n(D) Why it's incorrect: The procedure involves inserting a large-bore needle through the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscles into the chest cavity. It would be extremely painful without anesthesia. Local anesthesia (like lidocaine) is always used to numb the insertion site.",
    "additional": "Patient Positioning for Thoracentesis: The patient is typically positioned sitting on the edge of the bed, leaning forward over a bedside table.

A sudden change to bright red blood indicates active bleeding.\n\nAmount of drainage: This must be measured and recorded regularly (e.g., every hour in the immediate post-op period, then every 4-8 hours). A sudden large increase in drainage (>100-200 mL/hr) can signify hemorrhage.\n\n(A), (C), and (D) Why they are incorrect:\n\n(A) While checking for patent connections is crucial, \"amount\" of drainage is a more fundamental assessment than \"patent connections.\" Amount is a direct patient outcome measurement.\n\n(C) & (D) While assessing patient understanding is an important part of nursing care, it is not a primary physical observation of the drainage system's function or the patient's physiological status.

    "explanation": "Correct (b): Laryngotracheobronchitis, commonly known as croup, is a viral infection that causes inflammation and swelling of the larynx (voice box), trachea (windpipe), and bronchi. This swelling narrows the upper airway and leads to the classic triad of symptoms: a harsh, seal-like barking cough, inspiratory stridor (a high-pitched breathing sound), and hoarseness.\n\nIncorrect (a, c, d):\n\na) A moist or productive cough is typical of lower respiratory infections like pneumonia or bronchitis.\n\nc) A muffled voice (\"hot potato voice\") is more characteristic of epiglottitis, a bacterial infection that is a medical emergency.\n\nd) Wheezing is a high-pitched whistling sound on expiration, caused by narrowed lower airways, and is the hallmark of asthma or bronchiolitis.",
    "additional": "Deeper Insight: Croup is most common in young children. Management focuses on reducing airway inflammation. For mild cases, cool, humidified air (e.g., from a shower or cool mist humidifier) can be effective.

      "a": "Corticosteroids",
      "b": "Mast cell stabiliser",
      "c": "Leukotriene modifier",
      "d": "(Missing option, but context implies a short-acting bronchodilator)"
    },
    "answer": "a",
    "explanation": "First-Line Treatment (SABA - e.g., Albuterol): The immediate priority in an acute asthma attack (exacerbation) is to relieve bronchospasm and open the airways. This is done with a short-acting beta-agonist (SABA), which is a fast-acting bronchodilator. This is the \"rescue\" inhaler.\n\nAdjunctive Treatment (a) Corticosteroids: Systemic corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone, methylprednisolone) are used in moderate to severe exacerbations to decrease airway inflammation. They are not fast-acting but are crucial for resolving the attack and preventing a relapse. Their effect takes hours to begin.\n\nIncorrect (b, c): Mast cell stabilizers (e.g., cromolyn sodium) and leukotriene modifiers (e.g., montelukast) are controller/preventer medications. They are taken daily to prevent asthma attacks from occurring and have no role in treating an acute attack.",
    "additional": "Deeper Insight: Asthma management is divided into two categories:\n\nReliever/Rescue Meds: For acute symptoms (SABAs, anticholinergics).\n\nController/Preventer Meds: For long-term control (Inhaled corticosteroids, LABAs, leukotriene modifiers, mast cell stabilizers).\n\nPossible Next Question (NCK Focus): \"A client using an albuterol inhaler for an acute asthma attack reports feeling shaky and having a rapid heart rate. What is the nurse's best response?\" The nurse should explain that tachycardia and tremors are common side effects of this medication."

    "question": "The nurse evaluates a client following treatment for carbon monoxide poisoning. The nurse would document that the treatment was effective if which of the following were present?;",
    "options": {
      "a": "The client is sleeping soundly",
      "b": "The client is awake and talking",
      "c": "The heart monitor shows sinus tachycardia",
      "d": "Carboxyhemoglobin levels are less than 5%"
    },
    "answer": "d",
    "explanation": "Correct (d): Carbon monoxide (CO) binds to hemoglobin with an affinity >200 times that of oxygen, forming carboxyhemoglobin (COHb). This prevents oxygen from binding and leads to tissue hypoxia. The definitive measure of both the severity of the poisoning and the effectiveness of treatment is the serum carboxyhemoglobin level. A normal level for a non-smoker is <2%; a level <5% indicates that the treatment (usually 100% high-flow oxygen) has been effective in displacing the CO from hemoglobin.\n\nIncorrect (a, b): While being awake and talking is a positive clinical sign, it is subjective. A patient could still have dangerously high COHb levels. Sleeping soundly could be a sign of continued CNS depression from the poisoning.\n\nIncorrect (c): Sinus tachycardia is a compensatory response to hypoxia and may persist for some time. Its presence does not confirm that the underlying cause has been resolved.",
    "additional": "Deeper Insight: The treatment for CO poisoning is 100% oxygen administered via a non-rebreather mask to shorten the half-life of COHb and accelerate the elimination of CO. In severe cases, hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy may be used. A classic but often subtle sign of CO poisoning is a cherry-red skin color, but this is a late finding and often not present. Pulse oximetry is unreliable in CO poisoning because the pulse oximeter cannot differentiate between oxyhemoglobin and carboxyhemoglobin, giving a falsely high SpO2 reading.\n\nPossible Next Question (NCK Focus): \"A client is admitted from a house fire with suspected carbon monoxide poisoning. Their pulse oximeter reads 99%. What is the nurse's priority action?\" The answer would be to administer 100% oxygen via a non-rebreather mask and draw blood for a carboxyhemoglobin level."

    "question": "A client with significant flail chest has arterial blood gases (ABGs) that reveal a PaO2 was 68 and that PaCO2 was 51. Two hours ago the PaO2 was 82 and the PaCO2 was 44. Based on these changes the nurse obtains which of the following items?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Intubation tray",
      "b": "Chest tube insertion set",
      "c": "Portable chest X-ray machine",
      "d": "Injection lidocaine (Xylocaine)"
    },
    "answer": "a",
    "explanation": "Correct (a): These ABG results show worsening acute respiratory failure. The PaO2 has dropped significantly (hypoxemia, normal is 80-100 mmHg), and the PaCO2 has risen (hypercapnia, normal is 35-45 mmHg). This indicates the patient is no longer able to maintain adequate ventilation and oxygenation. Flail chest (multiple adjacent rib fractures) causes paradoxical chest wall movement and severe pain, leading to shallow breathing (hypoventilation). The worsening gas exchange is a clear indication for imminent mechanical ventilation. The nurse must anticipate this and prepare an intubation tray.\n\nIncorrect (b, c, d):\n\nb) A chest tube is for a pneumothorax or hemothorax, which can accompany flail chest, but the immediate problem indicated by the ABGs is ventilatory failure, not a collapsed lung.\n\nc) A chest X-ray is useful, but preparing for airway management is the life-saving priority.\n\nd) Lidocaine is a local anesthetic or antiarrhythmic and is not relevant here. Pain control (e.g., with IV opioids or an epidural) is vital for flail chest but will not reverse this degree of respiratory failure.",
    "additional": "Deeper Insight: The primary treatment for severe flail chest is to stabilize the chest wall from the inside out using positive pressure ventilation (intubation). This internal \"splinting\" allows the fractures to heal while ensuring adequate gas exchange. Aggressive pain management is also key to allow the patient to breathe as deeply as possible.\n\nPossible Next Question (NCK Focus): \"A nurse observes paradoxical chest wall movement in a trauma client. What is the nurse's priority action?\" The answer is to administer high-flow oxygen and prepare for possible intubation."

    "question": "A hospitalized client is dyspneic and has been diagnosed with a left tension pneumothorax by chest X-ray after insertion of a central venous catheter. Which of the following indicates that the pneumothorax is worsening?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Hypertension",
      "b": "Flat neck veins",
      "c": "Pain with respiration",
      "d": "Tracheal deviation to the right"
    },
    "answer": "d",
    "explanation": "Correct (d): A tension pneumothorax is a life-threatening emergency. Air enters the pleural space on inspiration but cannot escape, causing a one-way-valve effect. The pressure builds, completely collapsing the affected lung (the left lung in this case) and pushing the entire mediastinum (heart, great vessels, trachea) to the opposite side. Therefore, tracheal deviation to the right is a classic, late sign of a worsening left tension pneumothorax.\n\nIncorrect (a, b, c):\n\na) The patient will have severe hypotension, not hypertension, due to compression of the great vessels, which impairs venous return to the heart.\n\nb) The patient will have distended neck veins (JVD), not flat neck veins, due to the impaired venous return.\n\nc) Pain with respiration (pleuritic pain) is a symptom of any pneumothorax, not specifically a sign of it worsening into a tension pneumothorax.",
    "additional": "Deeper Insight: A tension pneumothorax is a clinical diagnosis. One should not wait for an X-ray if the signs are present (severe respiratory distress, hypotension, JVD, unilateral absence of breath sounds, and tracheal deviation). The immediate treatment is needle decompression (inserting a large-bore needle into the 2nd intercostal space, midclavicular line) followed by chest tube insertion.\n\nPossible Next Question (NCK Focus): \"A nurse is assessing a client with a chest tube for a pneumothorax. Which finding requires immediate intervention?\" An answer could be continuous bubbling in the water seal chamber (indicating a persistent air leak) or no tidaling in the water seal chamber when the patient is not on suction (indicating a possible obstruction)."

  {
    "question": "A client involved in a house fire is experiencing respiratory distress, and an inhalation injury is suspected. The nurse monitors which of the following for the presence of monoxide poisoning?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Pulse oximetry",
      "b": "Urine myoglobin",
      "c": "Sputum carbon levels",
      "d": "Serum carboxyhemoglobin levels"
    },
    "answer": "d",
    "explanation": "Correct (d): This question is very similar to Q16. The gold standard for diagnosing and monitoring carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is a direct measurement of the serum carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) level via an arterial or venous blood sample. This test quantifies the percentage of hemoglobin that is saturated with CO instead of oxygen.\n\nIncorrect (a): Pulse oximetry is notoriously unreliable and falsely reassuring in CO poisoning because it cannot distinguish COHb from oxyhemoglobin.\n\nIncorrect (b): Urine myoglobin would be checked for rhabdomyolysis, a complication of severe burns or crush injuries, but not for CO poisoning itself.\n\nIncorrect (c): Sputum may contain soot or carbon particles, which is a strong indicator of an inhalation injury, but it does not quantify the systemic poisoning from CO.",
    "additional": "Deeper Insight: Any patient from an enclosed-space fire should be assumed to have CO poisoning until proven otherwise. Key signs of inhalation injury (which often co-occurs) include facial burns, singed nasal hairs, hoarseness, and carbonaceous sputum. These patients are at high risk for developing delayed airway edema and should be monitored very closely for at least 24 hours.\n\nPossible Next Question (NCK Focus): \"A patient with an inhalation injury develops increasing hoarseness and difficulty swallowing. What should the nurse anticipate?\" The answer is the need for prophylactic intubation before the airway swells shut completely."

    "question": "During bronchoscopy, a patient experiences vagal response. The nurse should expect the following;",
    "options": {
      "a": "Bronchodilation",
      "b": "Tachycardia",
      "c": "Bradycardia",
      "d": "Reduced gastrointestinal secretion"
    },
    "answer": "c",
    "explanation": "Correct (c): A bronchoscopy involves stimulating the airways, which are heavily innervated by the vagus nerve (CN X). Vagal stimulation (a vasovagal response) activates the parasympathetic nervous system. The primary cardiovascular effect of parasympathetic activation is a slowing of the heart rate (bradycardia). Hypotension can also occur.\n\nIncorrect (a, b, d):\n\na) Vagal stimulation causes bronchoconstriction, not bronchodilation.\n\nb) Tachycardia is a result of sympathetic stimulation.\n\nd) Vagal stimulation increases gastrointestinal secretions and motility.",
    "additional": "Deeper Insight: Because of this risk, patients are continuously monitored (ECG, BP, SpO2) during a bronchoscopy. Atropine, a medication that blocks the vagus nerve and increases heart rate, should be readily available to treat symptomatic bradycardia if it occurs.\n\nPossible Next Question (NCK Focus): \"What is the priority nursing intervention after a client has had a bronchoscopy?\" The answer is to keep the client NPO (nothing by mouth) until the gag reflex has returned to prevent aspiration."

    "question": "A patient with stage IV HIV develops pneumocystis pneumonia. Which is the priority nursing diagnosis for this patient.",
    "options": {
      "a": "Impaired oxygenation",
      "b": "Impaired activity intolerance",
      "c": "Impaired nutrition",
      "d": "Impaired immunity"
    },
    "answer": "a",
    "explanation": "Correct (a): Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii, is a severe opportunistic infection that causes inflammation and fluid buildup in the alveoli. This directly interferes with the diffusion of gases across the alveolar-capillary membrane. The result is profound hypoxemia. Therefore, using Maslow's hierarchy or the ABCs, Impaired Oxygenation (or Impaired Gas Exchange) is the life-threatening priority.\n\nIncorrect (b, c, d):\n\nb) Activity intolerance is a result of the poor oxygenation and is a secondary problem.\n\nc) Impaired nutrition is a long-term issue in HIV but not the immediate priority during an acute pneumonia.\n\nd) Impaired immunity is the underlying cause of the patient's susceptibility to PCP, but it is not the immediate physiological problem that needs to be addressed. The result of the impaired immunity (the pneumonia and subsequent hypoxemia) is the priority.",
    "additional": "Deeper Insight: The treatment for PCP is Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX, Bactrim). In moderate to severe cases with significant hypoxemia (PaO2 < 70 mmHg), corticosteroids are added to reduce the intense inflammatory response in the lungs, which can improve survival.\n\nPossible Next Question (NCK Focus): \"A nurse is teaching a client with a CD4 count of 150 cells/mm³ about preventing opportunistic infections. Which instruction is most important?\" The answer would be \"You will need to take a medication like TMP-SMX daily to prevent PCP pneumonia.\""

    "question": "The following is a correct advise for a chronic bronchitis patient undergoing teaching of breathing exercise;",
    "options": {
      "a": "Exhale through the mouth",
      "b": "Use diaphragmatic breathing",
      "c": "Use chest breathing",
      "d": "Make inhalation longer than exhalation"
    },
    "answer": "b",
    "explanation": "Correct (b): The goal of breathing exercises in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), like chronic bronchitis, is to improve ventilation efficiency and reduce the work of breathing. Diaphragmatic (or abdominal) breathing is the most effective technique. It strengthens the diaphragm, slows the respiratory rate, and reduces the use of accessory muscles, which are inefficient and consume a lot of oxygen.\n\nIncorrect (a, c, d):\n\na) While exhaling through the mouth is part of pursed-lip breathing, this option is less complete than (b).\n\nc) Patients with COPD already overuse their chest/accessory muscles. The goal is to teach them not to use chest breathing.\n\nd) The correct technique is to make exhalation longer than inhalation (typically twice as long). This is the principle of pursed-lip breathing, which helps keep airways open longer and gets trapped air out.",
    "additional": "Deeper Insight: The two key breathing exercises for COPD are:\n\nPursed-Lip Breathing: Inhale through the nose for 2 counts, then exhale slowly through pursed lips (like whistling) for 4–6 counts. This creates positive back-pressure to prevent airway collapse during exhalation.\n\nDiaphragmatic Breathing: Lie down with one hand on the chest and one on the abdomen. Breathe in so that the hand on the abdomen rises while the hand on the chest stays still. Exhale slowly while the abdomen falls.\n\nPossible Next Question (NCK Focus): \"A nurse is teaching a client with emphysema about pursed-lip breathing. What is the primary purpose of this technique?\" The answer is to prevent airway collapse and prolong exhalation to remove trapped air."

    "question": "A patient's arterial blood gas analysis are as follows: PH is 7.4, partial pressure of CO2 56MmHg, bicarbonate 26.0 meq/l. What is the abnormality present in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Metabolic alkalosis",
      "b": "Metabolic Acidosis",
      "c": "Respiratory alkalosis",
      "d": "Respiratory acidosis"
    },
    "answer": "d",
    "explanation": "Step 1: Analyze the pH. pH = 7.40. This is in the normal range (7.35–7.45). This indicates compensation has occurred. Is it on the acidotic side (7.35–7.40) or alkalotic side (7.40–7.45)? It's right in the middle, but the other values will tell us the primary problem.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the PaCO2. PaCO2 = 56 mmHg. This is high (acidic). The normal range is 35–45 mmHg. A high PaCO2 indicates Respiratory Acidosis.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the HCO3. HCO3 = 26.0 mEq/L. This is on the high end of normal (normal range is 22–26 mEq/L). The kidneys have retained bicarbonate (a base) to buffer the high levels of acid (CO2), bringing the pH back to normal.\n\nConclusion: The primary problem is high CO2 (respiratory acidosis), and the kidneys have compensated by retaining HCO3, resulting in a normal pH. Therefore, this is fully compensated respiratory acidosis.",
    "additional": "Deeper Insight: This ABG pattern is classic for a patient with chronic COPD. Their bodies have had time to adapt to chronically high CO2 levels by having the kidneys conserve bicarbonate. This is different from an acute respiratory acidosis, where the pH would be low (<7.35) because the kidneys have not had time to compensate.\n\nPossible Next Question (NCK Focus): An ABG interpretation for a different condition. E.g., \"pH 7.30, PaCO2 38, HCO3 18.\" This would be uncompensated metabolic acidosis (common in DKA or renal failure)."

      "c": "Weight gain with no night sweats",
      "d": "Improvement of abnormal chest x-ray findings"
    },
    "answer": "a",
    "explanation": "Correct (a): The definitive proof that antituberculous therapy is effective is the eradication of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria from the body. This is measured by obtaining serial sputum samples for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear and culture. A conversion from a positive to a negative sputum culture is the most reliable indicator of a successful bacteriological response. This typically takes several weeks to months, but it is the ultimate goal.\n\nIncorrect (b): A tuberculin skin test (TST or Mantoux test) will remain positive for life once a person is infected. It does not revert to negative after treatment.\n\nIncorrect (c): Improvement in clinical symptoms like fever, night sweats, and weight loss is a very good sign that the treatment is working, but it is not as definitive as microbiological clearance.\n\nIncorrect (d): Chest x-ray findings improve much more slowly and may never return completely to normal, with some scarring often remaining. Therefore, it is not the best indicator for monitoring early treatment response.",
    "additional": "Deeper Insight: Patients are generally considered non-infectious to others after 2–3 weeks of effective therapy, provided their clinical symptoms are improving and their sputum smears are becoming negative. The full course of treatment for active TB is long, typically 6 months or more, to ensure all bacteria are killed and prevent relapse.\n\nPossible Next Question (NCK Focus): \"A nurse is providing education to a client starting on a multi-drug regimen for active TB that includes rifampin. What information is essential to include?\" The nurse must teach the client that rifampin will turn body fluids (urine, sweat, tears) a harmless orange-red color and can make contact lenses permanently stained."

    "explanation": "Correct (a): Assuming the system can be reconnected quickly and cleanly, this is the priority to re-establish the negative pressure system. If the old system is contaminated, a new one should be used.\n\nIncorrect (b): Calling the physician is important, but it is not the immediate action. The nurse must intervene first to protect the patient.\n\nIncorrect (c): Clamping a chest tube is dangerous, especially in a patient with a pneumothorax. It can cause air to build up in the pleural space, leading to a recurrent tension pneumothorax. Clamping is only done for very brief periods under specific circumstances (e.g., changing the drainage system).\n\nIncorrect (d): This is false reassurance and delays a critical intervention.",
    "additional": "Deeper Insight: The emergency equipment that should always be at the bedside of a patient with a chest tube includes: two padded clamps, a bottle of sterile water, and a sterile occlusive dressing (e.g., Vaseline gauze).\n\nTube disconnects from system: Place end of tube in sterile water.\n\nTube pulls out of chest: Immediately cover the site with a sterile occlusive dressing, taped on three sides only. This allows air to escape but not enter.\n\nPossible Next Question (NCK Focus): \"A nurse is caring for a patient whose chest tube has accidentally been pulled out of the chest.

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The statement \"I always see flashing lights just before my seizure\" describes an aura, which is a warning sign of an impending seizure. While all the listed actions are part of seizure management, the question asks for the priority intervention immediately following the seizure (in the postictal phase). The nursing priority is always guided by the ABCs: Airway, Breathing, and Circulation.\n\nAssess the airway: Immediately after a tonic-clonic seizure, the client may have a compromised airway due to relaxation of the tongue and jaw muscles or the presence of secretions. Ensuring a patent airway is the absolute first step.",

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Ipratropium Bromide (Atrovent) is an anticholinergic bronchodilator. It works by blocking acetylcholine receptors in the airways, which leads to relaxation of the smooth muscles around the bronchi and results in bronchodilation (opening of the airways).\n\nWheezing is a high-pitched whistling sound caused by air moving through narrowed airways. Effective bronchodilation will open these narrowed airways, allowing air to move more freely and thus decreasing or eliminating wheezing.",
    "additional": "Use: Ipratropium is a cornerstone medication for managing Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). It is a maintenance (long-term control) medication, not a rescue inhaler for acute attacks.\n\nCombination Therapy: Often combined with a short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) like albuterol (e.g., Combivent Respimat) for enhanced bronchodilation.\n\nSide Effects: Are typically anticholinergic in nature (dry mouth, blurred vision, urinary retention), but systemic effects are minimal with the inhaled route.

    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Emphysema is one of the main conditions under the umbrella of COPD. Its defining characteristic is the destruction of the walls of the alveoli. This destruction leads to the loss of lung elasticity and collapse of small airways during exhalation. As a result, air becomes trapped in the lungs, causing the alveoli to become permanently overinflated and enlarged. This leads to a decrease in the surface area available for gas exchange.",
