  <h1>About Heartique Nursing Nexus Alliance</h1>
  
  <p><strong>Heartique Nursing Nexus</strong> is a student-powered, community-driven platform designed to revolutionize the way nursing students in Kenya access and interact with academic content. We provide well-organized, free, and always-accessible resources tailored specifically to the needs of nursing trainees across KMTCs, private institutions, and colleges.</p>

  <p>We believe that every student deserves a fair opportunity to succeed — and that access to quality academic materials shouldn’t be a privilege, but a right. From updated lecture notes and curated exam questions to revision materials, progress tracking, and study hacks, our platform is built with students in mind, by students who understand the struggle.</p>

  <p>More than just a notes archive, Heartique Nursing is a movement — a digital hub where dedication meets support, and learning becomes a shared journey. We are proud to create a space where future nurses feel empowered, supported, and inspired to grow academically and professionally.</p>

  <p>This initiative is curated and maintained by the <strong>Heartique Nursing Nexus Team</strong> — a passionate group of learners committed to transforming nursing education through digital innovation and peer support.</p>
