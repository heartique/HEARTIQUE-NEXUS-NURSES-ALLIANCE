    "question": "Que. 17. A Type of schizophrenia characterized mainly by delusions of persecution and auditory hallucinations is:-",
    "option": {
      "A": "Disorganized",
      "B": "Paranoid.",
      "C": "Catatonic.",
      "D": "Undifferentiated."
    },
    "answer": "(B) Paranoid.",
    "explanation": "Why 'B' (Paranoid) is Correct: Paranoid schizophrenia (a term now used as a specifier rather than a distinct subtype in the DSM-5) is primarily defined by the presence of prominent positive symptoms, specifically delusions and hallucinations. The delusions are often persecutory (believing one is being tormented, followed, or spied on) or grandiose (believing one has special powers or importance). Auditory hallucinations are also a hallmark feature. Cognitive functioning and affect are often less impaired compared to other types, meaning the person's speech and behavior may seem relatively normal outside the context of their delusions.\n\nWhy the Other Options are Incorrect:\n\nA. Disorganized: This type is characterized by disorganized speech (e.g., \"word salad,\" incoherence), disorganized behavior, and flat or inappropriate affect (e.g., laughing at a sad event). Delusions and hallucinations, if present, are not organized into a coherent theme.\n\nC. Catatonic: This type is defined by profound disturbances in motor behavior. This can range from motor immobility (stupor, catalepsy) and extreme negativism to excessive, purposeless motor activity. Other features include peculiar movements like posturing, echolalia (repeating others' words), and echopraxia (mimicking others' movements).\n\nD. Undifferentiated: This was a diagnosis used when a person exhibited clear symptoms of schizophrenia but did not meet the specific criteria for the paranoid, disorganized, or catatonic types.",
    "additional": "DSM-5 Update: It is critical to know that the DSM-5 (published in 2013) eliminated the subtypes of schizophrenia. This was done because the subtypes had poor diagnostic stability and limited clinical utility. Instead, schizophrenia is now diagnosed as a single disorder, and clinicians can use specifiers to describe the current presentation (e.g., \"with catatonia\"). An exam might ask why the subtypes were removed.\n\nPositive vs. Negative Symptoms: This is a core concept.\n\nPositive Symptoms are an addition of behaviors not normally present (e.g., hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech). The question describes positive symptoms.\n\nNegative Symptoms are an absence or reduction of normal functions (e.g., Anhedonia - inability to feel pleasure, Alogia - poverty of speech, Avolition - lack of motivation, Affective flattening). A future question could ask you to identify negative symptoms (like Que. 62 does).\n\nNursing Interventions for Paranoia: A common test question involves nursing care. For a patient with persecutory delusions, priority interventions include:\n- Building trust through consistency and honesty.\n- Not arguing with or trying to \"disprove\" the delusion; instead, focus on the underlying feeling (e.g., \"That must feel very frightening.\").\n- Ensuring safety (the patient may feel a need to strike out in \"self-defense\").\n- Providing pre-packaged food or unopened drinks if the patient has delusions about being poisoned."

    "question": "Que. 18. Reciprocal inhibition involves:",
    "option": {
      "A": "Continuous presentation of the phobic stimulus.",
      "B": "Hierarchical introduction of anxiety producing stimuli.",
      "C": "Elimination of behaviour by introduction of a more adaptive behaviour which is incompatible with the unacceptable behaviour.",
      "D": "Punishment during which the patient is removed from the environment where the unacceptable behaviour is being exhibited"
    },
    "answer": "(C) Elimination of behaviour by introduction of a more adaptive behaviour which is incompatible with the unacceptable behaviour.",
    "explanation": "Why 'C' is Correct: Reciprocal inhibition is a cornerstone of behavior therapy, developed by Joseph Wolpe. The core principle is that a person cannot experience two opposing emotional states (like anxiety and relaxation) at the same time. Therefore, the therapy works by teaching a person to replace the anxiety response with a relaxation response when confronted with a feared stimulus. The relaxation is the \"adaptive behaviour\" that is \"incompatible\" with the \"unacceptable behaviour\" of anxiety.\n\nWhy the Other Options are Incorrect:\n\nA. Continuous presentation of the phobic stimulus: This describes a technique called flooding or implosion therapy, where the patient is exposed to a high-intensity feared stimulus for a prolonged period without the option to escape, until the anxiety subsides.\n\nB. Hierarchical introduction of anxiety producing stimuli: This describes one component of a specific therapy called Systematic Desensitization. While it uses reciprocal inhibition as its mechanism, this option only describes the hierarchy, not the full process of replacing the anxiety response.\n\nD. Punishment...: This describes a form of negative punishment called time-out, an operant conditioning technique used to decrease an undesirable behavior. It is not reciprocal inhibition.",
    "additional": "Systematic Desensitization: This is the most common therapy that uses reciprocal inhibition. You should know its three steps:\n\nRelaxation Training: The patient learns deep muscle relaxation, breathing exercises, or meditation.\n\nAnxiety Hierarchy Construction: The patient and therapist create a list of anxiety-provoking situations related to the phobia, ranked from least to most frightening.\n\nPaired Exposure: The patient enters a state of deep relaxation and is then asked to imagine or confront the items on the hierarchy, starting with the least frightening. They do not move up the hierarchy until they can remain relaxed while thinking about the current item.\n\nOther Behavioral Therapies: Be able to differentiate between them:\n\nAversion Therapy: Pairing an unwanted behavior (e.g., drinking alcohol) with an unpleasant stimulus (e.g., a nausea-inducing drug like disulfiram/Antabuse).\n\nOperant Conditioning: Using reinforcement to increase desired behaviors (e.g., token economy) and punishment to decrease undesired behaviors.\n\nModeling: The therapist demonstrates appropriate behaviors in a feared situation for the patient to imitate."

    "question": "Que. 62. Negative symptoms of schizophrenia include:",
    "option": {
      "A": "Alogia, echolalia",
      "B": "Delusions, hallucinations",
      "C": "Avolition, anhedonia",
      "D": "Agitation, grandiosity"
    },
    "answer": "(C) Avolition, anhedonia",
    "explanation": "Why 'C' is Correct: This question tests your knowledge of negative symptoms, which represent a loss or deficit of normal functions. They are often referred to as the \"A\" symptoms:\n\nAvolition: A severe lack of motivation or initiative to accomplish purposeful tasks. The person may neglect personal hygiene, work, or social activities.\n\nAnhedonia: The inability to experience pleasure from activities that are usually found enjoyable, such as hobbies, social interactions, or even eating.\n\nAlogia: Poverty of speech; a reduction in the quantity of speech or content. Responses may be brief and empty.\n\nAffective Flattening (or Blunted Affect): A reduced range and intensity of emotional expression. The person's face may appear immobile and their voice monotonous.\n\nAsociality: A lack of interest in social interactions and a preference for solitary activities.\n\nWhy the Other Options are Incorrect:\n\nA. Alogia, echolalia: Alogia is a negative symptom, but echolalia (the pathological repeating of another's words) is a positive symptom, specifically a type of disorganized speech often seen in catatonia.\n\nB. Delusions, hallucinations: These are the classic positive symptoms of schizophrenia, representing an addition of a perceptual or thought disturbance.\n\nD. Agitation, grandiosity: Agitation is a state of motor restlessness and is a behavioral symptom. Grandiosity (or grandiose delusions) is a positive symptom involving a false belief of one's own importance or power.",
    "additional": "Clinical Significance of Negative Symptoms: Negative symptoms are often more difficult to treat with medication than positive symptoms. They are also a major cause of the poor social functioning and long-term disability associated with schizophrenia. A question might ask which type of symptom is more predictive of a poor long-term outcome (Answer: Negative symptoms).\n\nAntipsychotic Medications:\n\nFirst-Generation (Typical) Antipsychotics (e.g., Haloperidol, Chlorpromazine) are very effective at treating positive symptoms but are less effective for negative symptoms and have a high risk of extrapyramidal side effects (EPS).\n\nSecond-Generation (Atypical) Antipsychotics (e.g., Risperidone, Olanzapine, Clozapine) are effective for positive symptoms and are generally considered more effective than typicals for treating negative symptoms. They have a lower risk of EPS but a higher risk of metabolic side effects (weight gain, diabetes, dyslipidemia).\n\nCognitive Symptoms: Besides positive and negative symptoms, schizophrenia also involves cognitive symptoms, which are subtle but debilitating impairments in memory, attention, executive function (planning, decision-making), and processing speed. A question could ask you to identify a cognitive symptom."

    "question": "Que. 66. The use of benzodiazepines in anxiety disorders is based on their ability to act as agonists of:-",
    "option": {
      "A": "Acetylcholine",
      "B": "Y-aminobutyric acid (GABA)",
      "C": "Dopamine",
      "D": "Serotonin"
    },
    "answer": "(B) Y-aminobutyric acid (GABA)",
    "explanation": "Why 'B' (GABA) is Correct: Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS). Its job is to \"calm down\" or reduce neuronal excitability. Benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam, lorazepam, alprazolam) do not act as direct agonists but rather as positive allosteric modulators of the GABA-A receptor. This means they bind to a separate site on the receptor, which enhances the effect of GABA when it binds. This leads to an increased flow of chloride ions into the neuron, making it less likely to fire, resulting in a widespread calming, sedative, and anxiolytic (anxiety-reducing) effect. For the purpose of this multiple-choice question, \"acting as agonists\" is used loosely to mean \"enhancing the effect of.\"\n\nWhy the Other Options are Incorrect:\n\nA. Acetylcholine: This neurotransmitter is primarily involved in muscle contraction, memory, and autonomic nervous system functions. Drugs that block acetylcholine (anticholinergics) cause side effects like dry mouth, blurred vision, and constipation.\n\nC. Dopamine: This neurotransmitter is central to the brain's reward system, motivation, and motor control. Antipsychotic medications work by blocking dopamine receptors.\n\nD. Serotonin: This neurotransmitter is crucial for regulating mood, sleep, appetite, and anxiety. SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors) are a first-line treatment for anxiety disorders and work by increasing the amount of available serotonin in the synapse.",
    "additional": "Benzodiazepine Indications: Besides anxiety, they are used for insomnia, seizures (status epilepticus), muscle spasms, and alcohol withdrawal.\n\nRisks and Side Effects: A major topic for exams. Benzodiazepines are highly effective for short-term use, but their long-term use is discouraged due to:\n\nDependence and Addiction: High potential for physical and psychological dependence.\n\nTolerance: The need for higher doses to achieve the same effect.\n\nWithdrawal Syndrome: Abrupt cessation can cause a severe, potentially life-threatening withdrawal (anxiety, insomnia, tremors, seizures).\n\nCNS Depression: Sedation, drowsiness, and impaired coordination. The risk is dangerously potentiated when mixed with other CNS depressants like alcohol or opioids. A key patient teaching point is to avoid alcohol.\n\nAntidote: The antidote for benzodiazepine overdose is Flumazenil. This is a very common test question.\n\nAlternative Anxiolytics: Because of the risks of benzodiazepines, other drugs are often preferred for long-term management of anxiety, such as SSRIs/SNRIs (first-line) and Buspirone (a non-sedating, non-addictive anxiolytic)."

    "question": "Que. 68. During interview with a patient, the nurse becomes uncomfortable and realizes that the behaviour of the client reminds him/her of an abusive mother. This feeling by the nurse is:",
    "option": {
      "A": "Counter transference",
      "B": "Transference",
      "C": "Projection",
      "D": "Reaction formation"
    },
    "answer": "(A) Counter transference",
    "explanation": "Why 'A' (Counter transference) is Correct: Countertransference refers to the emotional reaction and unconscious feelings that the healthcare provider (nurse, therapist) has toward the patient. These feelings are often rooted in the provider's own past experiences, relationships, or unresolved conflicts. In this scenario, the patient's behavior triggers feelings in the nurse that are connected to the nurse's relationship with her own abusive mother. This is the classic definition of countertransference. It can be positive (e.g., over-identifying with a patient) or negative (e.g., feeling irrational anger or dislike), but either way, it can compromise the therapeutic relationship and objectivity.\n\nWhy the Other Options are Incorrect:\n\nB. Transference: This is the opposite phenomenon. Transference is when the patient unconsciously displaces feelings, attitudes, and expectations from a significant person in their past (like a parent) onto the healthcare provider. For example, if a patient becomes overly dependent on the nurse because the nurse reminds them of their nurturing grandmother.\n\nC. Projection: This is a defense mechanism where an individual attributes their own unacceptable thoughts, feelings, or motives to another person. For example, a person who is angry might accuse others of being hostile.\n\nD. Reaction formation: This is a defense mechanism where a person behaves in a way that is the exact opposite of their true, unacceptable feelings. For example, a person with unconscious hostile feelings towards a family member might be overly kind and solicitous toward them.",
    "additional": "Managing Countertransference: This is a key professional responsibility. A common test question might ask what the nurse should do if they recognize they are experiencing countertransference. The appropriate actions are:\n\nSelf-awareness and reflection: The first step is to recognize the feelings.\n\nSeek supervision or mentorship: Discussing the feelings with a trusted colleague, clinical supervisor, or mentor is the professional standard. This allows the nurse to gain insight and develop strategies to maintain a therapeutic relationship without allowing their personal feelings to interfere with patient care.\n\nMaintaining professional boundaries at all times.\n\nTherapeutic Use of Self: This is the core nursing concept that underpins the nurse-patient relationship. It involves using one's personality, experiences, and insight therapeutically. Recognizing and managing transference and countertransference is essential for the therapeutic use of self."

    "question": "Que. 69. You enter a room and find two colleagues arguing. One of them abruptly stops and gets angry with you. The colleague is using which coping mechanism?",
    "option": {
      "A": "Difussion",
      "B": "Displacement",
      "C": "Denial",
      "D": "Decompensation"
    },
    "answer": "(B) Displacement",
    "explanation": "Why 'B' (Displacement) is Correct: Displacement is a defense mechanism that involves shifting feelings or impulses (typically aggression or frustration) from a threatening or unavailable target to one that is less threatening or \"safer.\" In this scenario, the colleague is angry with the other person they were arguing with (the original, more threatening target). However, instead of continuing that confrontation, they redirect their anger towards you (a new, less threatening target who just walked in). This is a classic example of \"kicking the dog\" after having a bad day at work.\n\nWhy the Other Options are Incorrect:\n\nA. Difussion: This is not a standard term for a psychological defense mechanism. The word might be a distractor for \"diffusion of responsibility\" (a social psychology concept) or simply a typo.\n\nC. Denial: This is the refusal to accept reality or a fact, acting as if a painful event, thought, or feeling did not exist. For example, a person diagnosed with a terminal illness might insist the lab results are wrong.\n\nD. Decompensation: This is a clinical term, not a defense mechanism. It refers to the deterioration of mental health and loss of ability to cope with stress, often leading to an exacerbation of psychiatric symptoms.",
    "additional": "Common Defense Mechanisms for Exams: It's crucial to be able to identify and differentiate between various defense mechanisms. Here are a few more high-yield ones:\n\nRationalization: Creating a logical-sounding but false excuse to justify unacceptable behavior or feelings (e.g., \"I failed the test because the teacher doesn't like me,\" not because I didn't study).\n\nSublimation: Channeling unacceptable impulses into socially acceptable and constructive activities (e.g., a person with aggressive impulses becomes a competitive boxer, as seen in Que. 209). This is considered a mature, healthy defense mechanism.\n\nIntellectualization: Focusing on the intellectual/technical aspects of a situation to distance oneself from the associated emotions (e.g., a person diagnosed with cancer focuses intensely on the medical procedures and statistics instead of their fear, as seen in Que. 213).\n\nRepression: Unconsciously pushing unwanted or painful thoughts and memories into the unconscious mind. The person is unaware of the repressed material. (Contrast with Suppression, which is the conscious effort to put something out of mind)."

    "question": "Que. 70. A patient with Claustrophobia uses avoidance as a defence mechanism?",
    "option": {
      "A": "False",
      "B": "True",
      "C": ".",
      "D": "."
    },
    "answer": "(B) True",
    "explanation": "Why 'B' (True) is Correct: Claustrophobia is the specific phobia of enclosed or small spaces. Avoidance is the primary coping and defense mechanism used by individuals with phobias. By actively staying away from the feared object or situation (e.g., avoiding elevators, tunnels, small rooms, MRI machines), the individual prevents the onset of the intense anxiety or panic attack. This avoidance provides immediate relief from anxiety, which negatively reinforces the behavior, making the phobia more entrenched over time. While avoidance reduces short-term distress, it is maladaptive because it significantly restricts the person's life and prevents them from learning that the feared situation is not actually dangerous.",
    "additional": "Phobias - Key Concepts:\n\nA phobia is an irrational, intense, and persistent fear of a specific object, activity, or situation. The fear is excessive and out of proportion to the actual danger posed.\n\nExposure to the phobic stimulus provokes an immediate anxiety response, which can take the form of a situationally bound panic attack.\n\nTypes of Phobias: You should be able to differentiate them.\n\nSpecific Phobia: Fear of a single object or situation (e.g., flying, heights, animals, injections, blood). Claustrophobia is a type of specific phobia.\n\nSocial Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia): Fear of social or performance situations where one might be scrutinized by others, leading to embarrassment or humiliation.\n\nAgoraphobia: Fear and avoidance of situations where escape might be difficult or help might not be available in the event of a panic attack. This often leads to being homebound. (See Que. 77).\n\nTreatment for Phobias: As discussed in Que. 18, the most effective treatments are behavioral therapies that break the cycle of avoidance.\n\nSystematic Desensitization: Gradually exposing the patient to the feared stimulus while they are in a state of relaxation.\n\nFlooding: Intense, prolonged exposure to the feared stimulus.\n\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT): Helps patients identify and change the irrational thoughts that fuel their fear."

    "question": "Que. 71. A caretaker of a patient with anxiety disorders asks you for advise on diet of his patient. Which is the best advise you will give this patient.",
    "option": {
      "A": "Avoid caffeine and Chocolates",
      "B": "Increase intake of chocolates at home.",
      "C": "Ensure he only takes medication when in anxiety.",
      "D": "Should stay at home and be to chose to eat at home at will."
    },
    "answer": "(A) Avoid caffeine and Chocolates",
    "explanation": "Why 'A' is Correct: Caffeine is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant. It can mimic or worsen the physiological symptoms of anxiety, such as heart palpitations, restlessness, trembling, and insomnia. High doses of caffeine can even induce a panic attack in susceptible individuals. Chocolate contains caffeine as well as another stimulant, theobromine. Therefore, a key piece of non-pharmacological advice for managing anxiety is to reduce or eliminate the intake of stimulants like caffeine from coffee, tea, soda, energy drinks, and chocolate.\n\nWhy the Other Options are Incorrect:\n\nB. Increase intake of chocolates at home: This is the opposite of the correct advice. While chocolate can be a comfort food, its stimulant properties are counterproductive for managing an anxiety disorder.\n\nC. Ensure he only takes medication when in anxiety: This is poor pharmacological advice. While some medications for anxiety (like benzodiazepines) can be taken on a \"prn\" (as-needed) basis, many first-line treatments (like SSRIs) must be taken daily to be effective and maintain a stable therapeutic level. This option is overly simplistic and potentially dangerous.\n\nD. Should stay at home and be to chose to eat at home at will: This advice promotes avoidance, which is a maladaptive coping mechanism that worsens anxiety disorders (especially agoraphobia and social anxiety) in the long run. It does not address the dietary question and gives harmful behavioral advice.",
    "additional": "Lifestyle Modifications for Anxiety: This is a common topic for patient education questions. Besides reducing caffeine, other key recommendations include:\n\nRegular Exercise: A powerful, evidence-based intervention to reduce anxiety.\n\nStress Management Techniques: Mindfulness, meditation, deep breathing exercises, yoga.\n\nSleep Hygiene: Ensuring adequate and regular sleep is crucial, as sleep deprivation can significantly increase anxiety.\n\nBalanced Diet: Avoiding high-sugar foods that can cause energy crashes and mood swings.\n\nAvoiding Alcohol and Nicotine: While often used to \"self-medicate,\" both can worsen anxiety in the long term."

    "question": "Que. 73. The first step taken when managing a patient who has attempted committing suicide is:-",
    "option": {
      "A": "Ask the client to talk about the experience.",
      "B": "Take a history of the events leading to attempt",
      "C": "Examine the airway and neck.",
      "D": "Consult a psychiatrist."
    },
    "answer": "(C) Examine the airway and neck.",
    "explanation": "Why 'C' is Correct: This question is about prioritizing care using the fundamental nursing principle of \"Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs\" or the \"ABC's (Airway, Breathing, Circulation).\" A suicide attempt is a medical emergency first and a psychiatric emergency second. The patient's immediate physiological survival is the absolute top priority. Therefore, the first step is to assess and secure the patient's physical well-being. Examining the airway and neck is a critical part of the primary survey to ensure the patient can breathe, especially after attempts involving hanging, overdose (which can cause respiratory depression), or trauma.\n\nWhy the Other Options are Incorrect:\n\nA, B, and D: These are all crucial components of the psychiatric management of a suicide attempt, but they come after the patient has been medically stabilized. Asking the client to talk (A), taking a history (B), and consulting a psychiatrist (D) are psychosocial interventions that cannot be performed on a patient who is not physiologically stable. You must address life-threatening physical injuries before addressing the psychological ones.",
    "additional": "Suicide Risk Assessment: This is a core nursing competency. Key factors to assess include:\n\nIdeation: Are they having thoughts of self-harm?\n\nPlan: Do they have a specific plan? The more specific and detailed the plan, the higher the risk.\n\nMeans: Do they have access to the means to carry out the plan (e.g., firearms, pills)?\n\nIntent: How strong is their intention to act on their thoughts?\n\nProtective Factors: What are the reasons they have for living (e.g., family, religion, pets)?\n\nLevels of Observation: A common exam question involves the appropriate level of safety precautions.\n\nGeneral Observation: Standard checks.\n\nClose Observation (e.g., every 15 minutes): For patients at moderate risk.\n\nOne-to-One (1:1) Constant Observation: For patients at high, acute risk. The patient must be within arm's length of a staff member at all times, including when using the bathroom.\n\nEnvironmental Safety: The nurse is responsible for creating a \"suicide-proof\" environment by removing all potentially dangerous items (belts, shoelaces, plastic bags, razors, cords)."

    "question": "Que. 74. A patient with depression may suffer from constipation and urinary retention. This is due to:-",
    "option": {
      "A": "Poor food intake.",
      "B": "Lack of water intake.",
      "C": "Inadequate dietary intake.",
      "D": "Pyshomotor retardation and Side effects of medication."
    },
    "answer": "(D) Psychomotor retardation and Side effects of medication.",
    "explanation": "Why 'D' is Correct: This is the most comprehensive answer. Psychomotor retardation is a classic symptom of severe depression, involving a slowing down of both thought and physical movement. This generalized slowing affects all body systems, including the gastrointestinal tract, leading to decreased peristalsis and constipation. Furthermore, the most common class of antidepressants, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) (e.g., amitriptyline, imipramine), are well-known for their strong anticholinergic side effects, which include constipation, urinary retention, dry mouth, and blurred vision. Therefore, the symptoms can be caused by both the disease process itself and its treatment.\n\nWhy the Other Options are Incorrect:\n\nA, B, and C: While poor food intake (especially low fiber), lack of water, and inadequate diet can certainly cause or contribute to constipation, they are not the most direct or complete explanation in the context of clinical depression. These dietary issues are often symptoms of the underlying psychomotor retardation and avolition. Option D provides a more fundamental and inclusive cause that encompasses both the pathophysiology of the illness and the pharmacology of its treatment.",
    "additional": "Neurovegetative Signs of Depression: These are the key physical symptoms of depression that are often tested. Besides psychomotor retardation, they include:\n\nSleep Disturbances: Insomnia (especially early morning awakening) or hypersomnia.\n\nAppetite/Weight Changes: Significant weight loss or gain.\n\nFatigue or Loss of Energy (Anergia).\n\nDecreased Libido.\n\nAnticholinergic Effects: You must know these. The mnemonic \"Can't see, can't pee, can't spit, can't sh*t\" helps you remember:\n\nBlurred vision (can't see)\n\nUrinary retention (can't pee)\n\nDry mouth (can't spit)\n\nConstipation (can't sh*t)\n\nA question could ask for the nursing intervention for these side effects (e.g., advise sips of water, sugar-free candy, increase fiber and fluids, monitor urinary output)."

    },
    "answer": "(D) Quietly approach her, escort her to the room and assist her in getting dressed.",
    "explanation": "Why 'D' is Correct: This option demonstrates a professional, therapeutic, and safe approach.\n\n\"Quietly approach\": A calm, non-threatening demeanor is essential to avoid escalating the patient's manic state.\n\n\"Escort her to the room\": This removes the patient from the public area, protecting her dignity and preventing her from overstimulating or offending other patients. It provides a low-stimulus environment.\n\n\"Assist her in getting dressed\": This is a simple, direct, matter-of-fact intervention that addresses the immediate problem (inappropriate exposure) without being punitive or confrontational. It sets firm, non-judgmental limits on the behavior.\n\nWhy the Other Options are Incorrect:\n\nA. Confront the client: Confrontation is likely to be perceived as a challenge by a manic patient, escalating their behavior and potentially leading to agitation or aggression.\n\nB. Inform the staff members to ignore her: Ignoring sexually inappropriate and disinhibited behavior is unprofessional and unsafe. It fails to protect the patient's dignity and the therapeutic milieu of the unit. The nurse has a duty to intervene.\n\nC. Get the security to force the client: This is an overly restrictive and potentially punitive response that should only be considered as a last resort if the patient becomes physically aggressive and poses an immediate danger to self or others. Using force for non-compliance with dressing is inappropriate and escalatory.",
    "additional": "Key Features of Mania: A common topic for \"identify the symptom\" questions.\n\nElevated/Irritable Mood: Abnormally and persistently euphoric, expansive, or irritable mood.\n\nGrandiosity: Inflated self-esteem.\n\nDecreased Need for Sleep: Feeling rested after only 3 hours of sleep.\n\nPressured Speech: Rapid, loud, and difficult to interrupt.\n\nFlight of Ideas: Rapidly jumping from one topic to another.\n\nDistractibility: Attention is easily drawn to unimportant external stimuli.\n\nIncreased Goal-Directed Activity or Psychomotor Agitation.\n\nExcessive Involvement in Pleasurable but High-Risk Activities: Spending sprees, sexual indiscretions, foolish investments.\n\nNursing Interventions for Mania:\n\nSafety: The top priority, as poor judgment leads to risk-taking.\n\nLow-Stimulus Environment: Reduce noise, light, and people to decrease agitation.\n\nLimit Setting: Set firm, consistent, non-punitive limits on behavior.\n\nNutrition: Provide high-calorie, high-protein \"finger foods\" and drinks that the patient can consume \"on the go,\" as they will not sit down for a full meal.\n\nSleep: Promote rest and sleep; monitor for exhaustion."

    "answer": "(A) Agoraphobia",
    "explanation": "Why 'A' (Agoraphobia) is Correct: Agoraphobia is characterized by an intense fear or anxiety about two or more of the following situations: using public transportation, being in open spaces (e.g., parking lots), being in enclosed places (e.g., theaters), standing in line or being in a crowd, or being outside of the home alone. The core fear is that escape might be difficult or help might not be available if they develop panic-like symptoms or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms (like the \"fear of doing something crazy\"). This fear leads to active avoidance of these situations, requiring a companion, or enduring the situations with intense fear. The client's behavior—being homebound and needing a trusted adult to go out—is the classic presentation of agoraphobia.\n\nWhy the Other Options are Incorrect:\n\nB. Hematophobia: This is a specific phobia of blood.\n\nC. Claustrophobia: This is a specific phobia of enclosed spaces. While an agoraphobic person might fear enclosed spaces, their fear is broader and tied to the inability to escape or get help, not just the space itself.\n\nD. Hypochondriasis: This is now known as Illness Anxiety Disorder. It is a preoccupation with having or acquiring a serious illness, despite having no (or very mild) somatic symptoms. The focus is on the illness itself, not on having a panic attack in public.",
    "additional": "Agoraphobia and Panic Disorder: Agoraphobia can occur with or without Panic Disorder. Many, but not all, people with agoraphobia have a history of panic attacks and fear having another one in a \"vulnerable\" situation. An exam question might test the relationship between the two.\n\nNursing Interventions for Agoraphobia:\n\nThe primary goal is to help the client break the cycle of avoidance.\n\nInitially, establish trust and do not force the client into feared situations.\n\nTeach relaxation techniques (deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation).\n\nUtilize cognitive-behavioral techniques to challenge catastrophic thinking.\n\nEncourage gradual exposure (a form of desensitization), perhaps starting with a short walk outside with the nurse, then alone, then to a nearby shop."

    "question": "Que. 78. A client is unwilling to go into an enclosed place because she fears something bad may happen to her. The nurse determines that the client has:-",
    "option": {
      "A": "Claustrophobia",
      "B": "Agoraphobia",
      "C": "Photophobia",
      "D": "Acrophobia"
    },
    "answer": "(A) Claustrophobia",
    "explanation": "Why 'A' (Claustrophobia) is Correct: This question describes a fear that is specifically tied to enclosed places. This is the definition of claustrophobia, which is a type of specific phobia. The fear might be about suffocation, being trapped, or a general sense of \"something bad\" happening within that confined context.\n\nWhy the Other Options are Incorrect:\n\nB. Agoraphobia: As explained in the previous question, agoraphobia is a broader fear of various situations where escape might be difficult. While it can include a fear of enclosed places, this question's focus is narrowly on that one trigger, making claustrophobia the more precise answer. If the question had mentioned fear of crowds, open spaces, and enclosed spaces, agoraphobia would be a better fit.\n\nC. Photophobia: This is a medical term for eye discomfort or pain due to light exposure. It is a symptom of conditions like meningitis or migraine headaches, not a psychiatric disorder.\n\nD. Acrophobia: This is a specific phobia of heights.",
    "additional": "Differentiating Phobias: Exam questions often require you to differentiate between various specific phobias by their Greek/Latin roots.\n\nArachnophobia = Spiders\n\nOphidiophobia = Snakes\n\nAcrophobia = Heights\n\nCynophobia = Dogs\n\nTrypanophobia = Injections\n\nNursing Priority During a Panic Attack: If a client with a phobia is exposed to the stimulus and has a panic attack, the nurse's immediate priority is to ensure the client's safety and provide a calm, reassuring presence. Stay with the client, use simple language, and guide them in slow, deep breathing."

    "question": "Que. 80. Primary level of prevention is exemplified by:",
    "option": {
      "A": "Helping the client resume self care.",
      "B": "Ensuring the safety of a suicidal client in the institution.",
      "C": "Teaching the client stress management techniques",
      "D": "Case finding and surveillance in the community Question"
    },
    "answer": "(C) Teaching the client stress management techniques.",
    "explanation": "Why 'C' is Correct: This question asks for an example of primary prevention in mental health. Primary prevention aims to prevent the disorder from occurring in the first place by reducing risk factors and promoting protective factors in at-risk populations. Teaching stress management techniques to a general population (e.g., in a school or workplace) is a classic example. By equipping people with coping skills, you reduce the likelihood that stress will lead to the development of an anxiety or mood disorder.\n\nWhy the Other Options are Incorrect:\n\nA. Helping the client resume self care: This is an example of tertiary prevention. It focuses on rehabilitation and reducing the long-term disability from an existing, chronic illness. The client already has a disorder that has impacted their self-care.\n\nB. Ensuring the safety of a suicidal client in the institution: This is secondary prevention. The client already has a disorder (e.g., depression) and is exhibiting acute, severe symptoms (suicidality). Secondary prevention aims to identify problems early and provide prompt treatment to shorten the duration and severity of the illness. Crisis intervention falls here.\n\nD. Case finding and surveillance in the community: This also falls under secondary prevention. The goal of case finding and screening is to identify existing cases early so that treatment can be initiated.",
    "additional": "Levels of Prevention (Must-Know Concept): This is a fundamental concept in both community and mental health nursing.\n\nPrimary Prevention: Aims to prevent the initial occurrence of a disease or disorder. Example: Health education on the dangers of substance abuse, teaching parenting skills, stress management classes.\n\nSecondary Prevention: Aims to screen for and treat diseases in the early stages to shorten their duration and reduce morbidity. Example: Depression screening at a primary care clinic, crisis intervention for a suicidal patient, administering medication for acute symptoms.\n\nTertiary Prevention: Aims to reduce the long-term impact of a chronic illness and promote rehabilitation and recovery. Example: Running a psychosocial rehabilitation group for people with schizophrenia, vocational training, managing chronic symptoms."

    "question": "Que. 203. The nurse's patient with panic disorder is crying and hyperventilating and states \"Everything is falling apart!\" What should be the nurse's priority action?",
    "option": {
      "A": "Administer lorazepam.",
      "B": "Do a breathing exercise with him.",
      "C": "Calmly tell him to stop crying.",
      "D": "Ask the patient to talk about it."
    },
    "answer": "(B) Do a breathing exercise with him.",
    "explanation": "Why 'B' is Correct: The patient is experiencing an acute panic attack, characterized by intense fear, crying, and hyperventilation. Hyperventilation causes an excessive loss of carbon dioxide, leading to respiratory alkalosis, which in turn causes many of the physical symptoms of panic (dizziness, tingling, lightheadedness). The immediate nursing priority is to address this physiological imbalance. Guiding the patient through a slow, deep breathing exercise (e.g., \"Breathe with me. In through your nose for a count of four... out through your mouth for a count of six...\") directly counteracts the hyperventilation, helps restore normal CO2 levels, and activates the parasympathetic nervous system, promoting relaxation.\n\nWhy the Other Options are Incorrect:\n\nA. Administer lorazepam: While an anxiolytic like lorazepam may be ordered and eventually given, it is not the first or priority action. Nursing interventions that are non-invasive and directly address the immediate physiology should be tried first. Furthermore, the nurse needs a physician's order to administer medication.\n\nC. Calmly tell him to stop crying: This is dismissive and invalidating. It denies the patient's experience and can increase their sense of isolation and panic. A patient in a panic state cannot simply \"stop\" on command.\n\nD. Ask the patient to talk about it: During the peak of a panic attack, the patient's ability to process information and engage in rational thought is severely impaired. Trying to engage them in a therapeutic conversation about their feelings is ineffective and may increase their anxiety. The focus must first be on de-escalating the physical symptoms. Once the patient is calmer, exploring the triggers can occur.",
    "additional": "Nursing Interventions During a Panic Attack:\n\nStay with the patient: Do not leave them alone. This provides a sense of safety.\n\nMaintain a calm, serene demeanor: The nurse's calmness can be reassuring.\n\nUse simple, clear, one-step directions: Avoid complex explanations.\n\nMove the patient to a low-stimulus environment.\n\nAddress hyperventilation: Coach slow, deep breathing. Breathing into a paper bag (to \"rebreathe\" CO2) is an older technique but is less commonly used now due to risks if the patient has an underlying respiratory or cardiac condition.\n\nReassure them that they are safe and that the attack will pass (it typically peaks in about 10 minutes)."

    "question": "Que. 204. The nurse working on a psychiatric unit follows which of the following guidelines when offering medication to a client with paranoid schizophrenia in the client's room?",
    "option": {
      "A": "Offer medication when the client is calm.",
      "B": "Keep the door open and a clear exit path.",
      "C": "Only offer medication with another staff person.",
      "D": "Keep your back on the client and your eyes on the exit."
    },
    "answer": "(B) Keep the door open and a clear exit path.",
    "explanation": "Why 'B' is Correct: This is a fundamental safety principle when interacting with a potentially volatile patient, particularly one with paranoia. A patient with persecutory delusions may misinterpret the nurse's actions as threatening, especially in a closed, private space. Keeping the door open and ensuring that neither the nurse nor the patient is blocked from exiting reduces the patient's feeling of being trapped and provides a crucial escape route for the nurse if the patient becomes aggressive. It is a key de-escalation and self-preservation technique.\n\nWhy the Other Options are Incorrect:\n\nA. Offer medication when the client is calm: While this is ideal, it is not a guideline for the nurse's own safety. A patient's mood can shift unpredictably, and waiting for perfect calmness may not always be possible or safe.\n\nC. Only offer medication with another staff person: While having a second staff member present (\"a show of support\") can be very helpful and is often good practice, it may not always be feasible or necessary for every medication pass. The guideline in option B is more universally applicable to ensure the nurse's immediate safety in any one-on-one interaction.\n\nD. Keep your back on the client and your eyes on the exit: This is extremely dangerous advice. A nurse should never turn their back on a potentially aggressive patient. This makes the nurse vulnerable to attack. The correct posture is to stand at an angle (not directly face-to-face, which can be seen as confrontational), keeping the patient in view while also being aware of the exit.",
    "additional": "De-escalation Techniques:\n\nMaintain a calm tone of voice and demeanor.\n\nRespect personal space; do not stand too close.\n\nUse non-confrontational body language (e.g., stand at an angle, hands open and visible).\n\nDo not argue with delusions or make promises you can't keep.\n\nListen actively and validate the underlying emotion (e.g., \"I can see that you are very frightened right now.\").\n\nMedication Adherence in Paranoia: Patients with paranoid delusions are at high risk for non-adherence because they may believe their medication is poison. Nursing strategies include:\n\nPresenting medication in the same packaging or unopened packets if possible.\n\nUsing liquid or dissolving forms if the patient is \"cheeking\" (hiding) pills.\n\nConsidering long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotics for patients with a history of non-adherence."

    "question": "Que. 208. A patient is admitted to the psychiatric unit for psychosis. When asked about her home medications, she responds, \"I take metformin for... where did you get those shoes?\" This response is a(n):",
    "option": {
      "A": "Loose association.",
      "B": "Grandiose delusion.",
      "C": "Tangentiality.",
      "D": "Distractible speech."
    },
    "answer": "(A) Loose association.",
    "explanation": "Why 'A' (Loose association) is Correct: Loose association (also called derailment) is a thought process disorder characterized by a lack of logical connection between thoughts or ideas. The person shifts from one unrelated or vaguely related topic to another. In this example, the topic shifts abruptly from \"metformin\" to \"shoes\" with no clear, logical bridge between the two subjects. This represents a breakdown in the associative links that normally hold a conversation together.\n\nWhy the Other Options are Incorrect:\n\nB. Grandiose delusion: This is a false belief about one's own greatness, power, or importance. It is a disorder of thought content, not thought process.\n\nC. Tangentiality: This is very similar to loose association and often tested alongside it. In tangentiality, the person responds to a question by \"going off on a tangent\" and never returns to the original point. The key difference is that the initial part of the answer may be related to the question. Loose association is a more profound breakdown where the links are even less clear. However, without more context, some might argue for tangentiality. In this specific example, the jump is so abrupt and unrelated that loose association is the best fit.\n\nD. Distractible speech: This occurs when the patient's speech is repeatedly interrupted by and steered toward external stimuli. For example: \"I was going to the store and then I saw that bright red... that light is very bright... what was I saying?\" The patient's response here is a shift in internal thought, not a direct response to an external stimulus.",
    "additional": "Disorders of Thought Process: Be able to differentiate them.\n\nFlight of Ideas: Very rapid speech with abrupt changes from topic to topic, usually based on understandable associations or plays on words (puns). Seen in mania.\n\nCircumstantiality: The person provides excessive and unnecessary detail but eventually does get back to the original point of the question.\n\nWord Salad: A jumble of words that is completely incoherent and lacks any logical connection. The most extreme form of disorganized speech.\n\nNeologisms: Made-up words that have meaning only to the person using them.\n\nClang Associations: Choosing words based on their sound (rhyming) rather than their meaning (e.g., \"I went to the store, there's a door, let's get more.\")."
