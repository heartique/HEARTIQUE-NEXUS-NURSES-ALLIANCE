      "A": "BCG",
      "B": "Influenza",
      "C": "Shingles",
      "D": "Chickenpox"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The provided rationale is correct. The BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin) vaccine is a cornerstone of the KEPI schedule, administered at birth or at first contact with the health system. It is designed to protect against severe forms of Tuberculosis (TB) in young children, specifically TB meningitis and miliary TB.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n\nInfluenza: The flu vaccine is not part of the routine KEPI schedule for all infants. It is often recommended for high-risk populations, including young children, the elderly, and those with chronic illnesses, but it is not a universal vaccine in the program.\n\nShingles (Zoster): This vaccine is for preventing shingles in older adults (typically 50+) who have previously had chickenpox. It is not a pediatric vaccine.\n\nChickenpox (Varicella): While the varicella vaccine is common in other countries, it is not currently included in the routine KEPI schedule in Kenya. It is available in the private sector.",
    "additional": "Administration: The BCG vaccine is given as a single 0.05 ml intradermal injection into the outer surface of the left upper arm (deltoid region).\n\nBCG Scar: A successful BCG vaccination typically results in a small, raised scar at the injection site, which appears a few weeks to months after vaccination. This scar is often used as a visual marker of vaccination.\n\nPossible Next Questions: You could be asked about the route of administration (intradermal), the specific site (left deltoid), or the primary purpose of the vaccine (prevention of severe childhood TB).\n\nRecommended Reading:\n\nKenya Ministry of Health, Division of Vaccines and Immunization (DVI) - KEPI Training Manuals.\n\nWHO Position Paper on BCG Vaccines."

      "C": "To ensure all children receive essential vaccinations",
      "D": "To promote the use of herbal treatments"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The primary public health goal of the Kenya Expanded Program on Immunization (KEPI) is to increase immunization coverage and ensure that every child is fully vaccinated against major vaccine-preventable diseases. This directly contributes to reducing child morbidity (illness) and mortality (death).\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n\nA) To reduce the cost of vaccines: While cost-effectiveness is an important operational consideration, the primary goal is health outcomes, not just cost reduction.\n\nB) To eradicate all childhood diseases: This is an overly ambitious goal. Eradication is a specific term meaning the permanent global reduction of a disease to zero (e.g., Smallpox). KEPI's goal is the control and prevention of specific diseases, not the eradication of all of them.\n\nD) To promote the use of herbal treatments: This is incorrect. KEPI is a modern, evidence-based public health program focused on conventional vaccines.",
    "additional": "KEPI Strategies: To achieve its goal, KEPI employs several strategies, including:\n\nStatic immunization sites: At health facilities.\n\nOutreach services: Mobile clinics to reach remote or hard-to-reach populations.\n\nCold Chain Management: A system for storing and transporting vaccines at recommended temperatures.\n\nHealth Education: To inform parents and caregivers about the importance of vaccination.\n\nSurveillance: Monitoring disease outbreaks and adverse events following immunization (AEFI).\n\nPossible Next Questions: A question might focus on a specific KEPI strategy, such as, \"What is the term for the system used to maintain vaccine potency from manufacturer to administration?\" (Answer: Cold Chain).\n\nRecommended Reading:\n\nThe National Policy Guidelines on Immunization, 2013 (Kenya Ministry of Public Health and Sanitation)."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The Hepatitis B vaccine is specifically designed to prevent infection with the Hepatitis B virus (HBV), a major cause of acute and chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis and liver cancer. Under the KEPI schedule, it is given starting at birth to prevent mother-to-child transmission and as part of a combination vaccine later.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n\nRotavirus vaccine: Prevents severe diarrhea caused by rotavirus.\n\nDTP vaccine: Protects against Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis (whooping cough).\n\nPolio vaccine: Protects against the poliovirus.",
    "additional": "Hepatitis B Dosing Schedule (KEPI):\n\nBirth Dose: A monovalent (standalone) Hepatitis B vaccine is given within 24 hours of birth.\n\nCombination Doses: It is then given as part of a pentavalent vaccine (DTP-HepB-Hib) at 6, 10, and 14 weeks.\n\nImportance of the Birth Dose: The birth dose is critical for preventing perinatal (mother-to-child) transmission, which is a common mode of infection and carries a high risk of developing chronic liver disease.\n\nPossible Next Questions: \"Why is the Hepatitis B vaccine administered at birth?\" \"The pentavalent vaccine protects against which five diseases?\"\n\nRecommended Reading:\n\nKEPI Schedule provided by the Kenyan Ministry of Health."

      "B": "9 months",
      "C": "12 months",
      "D": "18 months"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The KEPI schedule recommends the first dose of the measles vaccine at 9 months of age. This timing is a balance between the waning of maternal antibodies (which can interfere with the vaccine's effectiveness if given too early) and the risk of the infant contracting measles.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n\n6 months: This is generally considered too early, as maternal antibodies are still present in most infants, which could neutralize the vaccine virus and lead to vaccine failure.\n\n12 months: While some countries give the first dose at 12 months, the 9-month schedule is used in regions with a high risk of measles transmission, like Kenya.\n\n18 months: This is the age for the second dose of the measles vaccine in the KEPI schedule.",
    "additional": "Measles-Rubella (MR) Vaccine: In Kenya, the measles vaccine is often administered as a combined Measles-Rubella (MR) vaccine to protect against both diseases.\n\nSecond Dose: A second dose is crucial for boosting immunity and protecting children who did not respond to the first dose. It is given at 18 months.\n\nPossible Next Questions: \"At what age is the second dose of the MR vaccine given?\" \"Why is the first dose of measles vaccine not given before 9 months of age?\"\n\nRecommended Reading:\n\nKenya National Immunization Schedule."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) is the primary vaccine used in the KEPI program to protect against poliomyelitis, a viral disease that can cause irreversible paralysis. It is a live-attenuated vaccine that is easy to administer.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n\nRotavirus vaccine: Protects against diarrheal disease.\n\nHepatitis A vaccine: Protects against Hepatitis A virus; not part of the routine KEPI schedule.\n\nDiphtheria vaccine: Given as part of the pentavalent (DTP-HepB-Hib) vaccine.",
    "additional": "Types of Polio Vaccines: Besides OPV, there is also the Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV), which is given by injection. Kenya's schedule includes both. IPV provides individual immunity, while OPV provides both individual and community (intestinal) immunity, which helps stop transmission.\n\nKEPI Polio Schedule:\n\nOPV: Given at birth (OPV-0), 6, 10, and 14 weeks.\n\nIPV: A single dose is given at 14 weeks.\n\nPossible Next Questions: \"What is the route of administration for OPV?\" (Answer: Oral). \"Which polio vaccine is administered via injection in the KEPI schedule?\" (Answer: IPV).\n\nRecommended Reading:\n\nGlobal Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) resources.\n\nKEPI training materials on polio vaccination."

    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The DTP vaccine is a combination vaccine that provides protection against three serious bacterial diseases:\n\nDiphtheria: A bacterial infection that can lead to a thick covering in the back of the throat, causing breathing difficulties, heart problems, and nerve damage.\n\nTetanus: Also known as \"lockjaw,\" it is caused by bacteria entering a wound, leading to painful muscle spasms.\n\nPertussis: Commonly known as \"whooping cough,\" it is a highly contagious respiratory infection that causes severe coughing spells.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n\nA) Hepatitis B: This is a separate vaccine, though it is combined with DTP and Hib in the pentavalent vaccine.\n\nC) Measles, mumps, and rubella: These are viral diseases prevented by the MMR or MR vaccine.\n\nD) Polio and tuberculosis: These are prevented by the Polio vaccine (OPV/IPV) and the BCG vaccine, respectively.",
    "additional": "Pentavalent Vaccine: In the current KEPI schedule, DTP is not given as a standalone vaccine but is part of the pentavalent vaccine. This single injection protects against five diseases: Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis, Hepatitis B, and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib).\n\nSchedule: The pentavalent vaccine is administered at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age.\n\nPossible Next Questions: \"What is the full name of the diseases prevented by the 'P' in DTP?\" (Answer: Pertussis). \"The DTP vaccine is administered as part of which combination vaccine in Kenya?\" (Answer: Pentavalent vaccine).\n\nRecommended Reading:\n\nGavi, the Vaccine Alliance - Information on the pentavalent vaccine.\n\nKEPI schedule and training manuals."

      "D": "4 months"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer provided in the document (A) reflects a common global schedule, but it's important to note the specific KEPI schedule. The rotavirus vaccine is administered orally to infants to protect against rotavirus, the most common cause of severe diarrheal disease in young children.\n\nKEPI Rotavirus Schedule: The vaccine is given in two doses: the first at 6 weeks and the second at 10 weeks of age. It is administered concurrently with the first and second doses of the pentavalent and PCV vaccines. Therefore, while \"2 months\" is close, the precise KEPI schedule starts at 6 weeks. For exam purposes, the closest correct option provided is often the intended answer.",
    "additional": "Route of Administration: The rotavirus vaccine is given orally as drops into the infant's mouth.\n\nImportance: Rotavirus infection can lead to severe dehydration, which is a major cause of hospitalization and death in infants and young children in low-resource settings. The vaccine is highly effective at preventing severe cases.\n\nPrecautions: There is a very small risk of intussusception (a condition where the intestine telescopes into itself) associated with the vaccine, which is why there are strict age limits for administration. The first dose should not be given after 15 weeks of age.\n\nPossible Next Questions: \"What is the route of administration for the Rotavirus vaccine?\" (Answer: Oral). \"How many doses of the Rotavirus vaccine are given in the KEPI schedule?\" (Answer: Two doses).\n\nRecommended Reading:\n\nWHO Position Paper on Rotavirus Vaccines.\n\nKenya National Immunization Schedule."

    "question": "What is the primary purpose of immunization in public health?",
    "options": {
      "A": "To create herd immunity",
      "B": "To prevent the spread of non-communicable diseases",
      "C": "To promote the use of antibiotics",
      "D": "To ensure lifelong immunity from all diseases"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The primary purpose of a mass immunization program is to achieve herd immunity (or community immunity). This occurs when a large enough proportion of a population is immune to an infectious disease (through vaccination or prior illness), making its spread from person to person unlikely. This provides indirect protection to vulnerable individuals who cannot be vaccinated (e.g., newborns, immunocompromised people).\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n\nB) To prevent non-communicable diseases: Immunization targets infectious (communicable) diseases, not non-communicable ones like diabetes or heart disease (though the HPV vaccine prevents cancer, which is an NCD).\n\nC) To promote the use of antibiotics: Immunization reduces the need for antibiotics by preventing bacterial infections in the first place.\n\nD) To ensure lifelong immunity: While many vaccines provide long-lasting immunity, it is not always lifelong. Some require booster doses.",
    "additional": "Herd Immunity Threshold: The percentage of the population that needs to be immune to achieve herd immunity varies by disease. For a highly contagious disease like measles, the threshold is very high (around 95%).\n\nIndividual vs. Community Benefit: Vaccination provides a direct benefit to the individual by protecting them from disease, and an indirect benefit to the community through herd immunity.\n\nPossible Next Questions: \"Define herd immunity.\" \"Why is herd immunity important for infants who are too young to be vaccinated?\"\n\nRecommended Reading:\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) - Principles of Epidemiology, Lesson 6: Investigating an Outbreak.

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The HPV (Human Papillomavirus) vaccine is designed to protect against infection with the most common types of HPV that cause cervical cancer and other cancers (e.g., anal, oropharyngeal) as well as genital warts. It is a primary prevention strategy against these malignancies.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n\nBCG: Prevents severe forms of TB.\n\nHepatitis B: Prevents liver infection and subsequent liver cancer caused by HBV.\n\nMeasles vaccine: Prevents measles, a viral infection.",
    "additional": "Target Population in Kenya: The HPV vaccine was introduced into the routine KEPI schedule in 2019, targeting 10-year-old girls. The program has since expanded its strategy to include girls up to 14 years old.\n\nDosing: It is typically administered in a two-dose schedule for this age group, with the doses given 6 months apart.\n\nRationale for Targeting Girls: The primary goal is to prevent cervical cancer, which is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death among women in Kenya.

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This question is slightly tricky because two vaccines in the KEPI schedule protect against causes of pneumonia. Both Hib and PCV are correct. However, of the options provided, Hib is the correct choice. The Hib (Haemophilus influenzae type b) vaccine protects against a bacterium that is a major cause of serious invasive diseases, including meningitis and pneumonia, in children under 5.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n\nRotavirus vaccine: Prevents diarrhea.\n\nInfluenza vaccine: Prevents influenza, which can lead to pneumonia, but it's not part of the routine KEPI schedule.\n\nPolio vaccine: Prevents poliomyelitis.",
    "additional": "Two Key Pneumonia Vaccines in KEPI:\n\nHib vaccine: Administered as part of the pentavalent vaccine at 6, 10, and 14 weeks.\n\nPneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV10): Protects against Streptococcus pneumoniae, another leading cause of pneumonia and meningitis.

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The primary mode of administration for the polio vaccine within Kenya's routine immunization and mass campaigns is the Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV). It is administered as drops into the mouth, making it easy to deliver on a large scale without the need for sterile syringes, which is a significant advantage in resource-limited settings.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n\nIntramuscular: This route is used for vaccines like Pentavalent, PCV, and IPV.\n\nIntradermal: This route is specifically used for the BCG vaccine.\n\nSubcutaneous: This route is used for the Measles-Rubella (MR) vaccine.",
    "additional": "Kenya's Combined Strategy: While OPV is the primary vaccine for population immunity and campaigns, Kenya also uses the Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV), which is given via intramuscular injection at 14 weeks. This dual approach provides robust protection. However, OPV is used more frequently (at birth, 6, 10, and 14 weeks).\n\nAdvantages of OPV: It is inexpensive, easy to administer, and provides intestinal immunity, which helps to stop the virus from spreading in the community.\n\nPossible Next Questions: \"Why is OPV preferred for mass immunization campaigns?\" \"Name a vaccine administered via the subcutaneous route in the KEPI schedule.\" (Answer: MR vaccine).\n\nRecommended Reading:\n\nKEPI Training Manuals on vaccine administration routes.\n\nWHO resources on polio eradication strategies."

    "explanation": "A contraindication is a specific situation in which a drug or vaccine should not be used because it may be harmful to the person. A history of a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to a previous dose of the vaccine or one of its components is an absolute contraindication for administering another dose.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n\nA mild cold, low-grade fever, or a running nose are considered minor illnesses and are not contraindications. These are false contraindications. Vaccination should proceed as scheduled to avoid missed opportunities.\n\nHigh fever (a precaution, not an absolute contraindication) would warrant delaying the vaccine until the child has recovered, but a history of fever after a previous dose is not a contraindication.",
    "additional": "Contraindication vs. Precaution:\n\nContraindication: A condition that makes a particular treatment or procedure absolutely inadvisable (e.g., anaphylaxis).\n\nPrecaution: A condition that might increase the risk of a serious adverse reaction or compromise the ability of the vaccine to produce immunity. In such cases, the vaccination might be deferred (e.g., moderate to severe acute illness).\n\nPertussis Component: Historically, neurologic reactions (like seizures) following a DTP dose were a concern, especially with the older whole-cell pertussis component. This is a precaution, and the child's case would be carefully evaluated.\n\nPossible Next Questions: \"Is a mild cough a valid reason to postpone vaccination?\" (Answer: No). \"Define anaphylaxis in the context of immunization.\"\n\nRecommended Reading:\n\nKEPI Guidelines on Contraindications and Precautions for Vaccination."
