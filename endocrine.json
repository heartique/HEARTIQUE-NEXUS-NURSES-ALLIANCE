      "B": "Low carbohydrate",
      "C": "High potassium",
      "D": "Low protein"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Addison's disease is primary adrenal insufficiency, meaning the adrenal glands do not produce enough cortisol and, crucially, aldosterone. Aldosterone's main function is to tell the kidneys to retain sodium (and water) and excrete potassium. In Addison's disease, the lack of aldosterone leads to excessive loss of sodium in the urine (hyponatremia) and retention of potassium (hyperkalemia). Therefore, the appropriate diet includes liberal sodium intake to compensate for these urinary losses.",
    "additional": "Why B, C, and D are incorrect:\nB: A normal carbohydrate intake is needed. The lack of cortisol can cause hypoglycemia, so adequate carbohydrates are important.\nC: The patient is already at high risk for hyperkalemia, so a diet high in potassium would be dangerous.\nD: There is no need for protein restriction.\n\nAdditional Possible Content to be Tested Next:\n- Signs of Addison's Disease: Hypotension, fatigue, weight loss, hypoglycemia, hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, and hyperpigmentation of the skin (\"bronze\" skin).\n- Addisonian Crisis: A life-threatening emergency caused by acute adrenal insufficiency.\n  - Triggers: Stress, infection, surgery, or sudden withdrawal of steroid medication.\n  - Signs: Severe hypotension, tachycardia, dehydration, hypoglycemia, shock.\n  - Treatment: Immediate IV administration of hydrocortisone, saline, and dextrose (D5NS).\n- Pharmacologic Treatment: Lifelong hormone replacement therapy with glucocorticoids (e.g., hydrocortisone, prednisone) and mineralocorticoids (fludrocortisone)."

    "explanation": "Background: This question addresses the key side effects and nursing responsibilities for a patient taking systemic corticosteroids (like prednisone or hydrocortisone).\n\n(B) Why it's correct: This option lists three of the most critical nursing interventions based on the primary effects of steroids:\n\nMaintain infection control: Steroids are potent immunosuppressants. They mask the signs of infection (like fever and inflammation) and increase the patient's susceptibility. Meticulous hand hygiene and protecting the patient from sources of infection are paramount.\n\nMonitor blood sugar: Steroids cause hyperglycemia by increasing gluconeogenesis in the liver and promoting insulin resistance. Blood glucose levels must be monitored regularly, even in non-diabetic patients.\n\nMaintain hydration: Steroids can cause fluid and electrolyte imbalances. Ensuring adequate hydration is important.\n\n(A) Why it's incorrect: While observing for edema and weighing daily are correct actions (due to sodium and water retention), monitoring blood counts is less of a priority unless there is a suspected infection (to check WBCs). Option (B) contains more critical, direct priorities.\n\n(C) Why it's incorrect: Steroids do not typically cause bone marrow suppression (chemotherapy does). They can cause osteoporosis long-term, but not acute suppression. Bed rest is not indicated unless for another reason.\n\n(D) Why it's incorrect: Anti-emetics are not routinely needed.

      "D": "injection sites can never be reused"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "(C) Why it's correct: This is the most complete and accurate reason. Repeatedly injecting insulin into the same spot can cause lipodystrophy. This can manifest in two ways:\n\nLipoatrophy: Loss of subcutaneous fat, causing a \"denting\" of the skin (less common with modern insulins).\n\nLipohypertrophy: Accumulation of subcutaneous fat, creating a spongy, thickened, or scar-like lump.\nThe primary problem with these areas is that insulin absorption becomes unpredictable and erratic. Injecting into a hypertrophied area can significantly delay insulin absorption, leading to unexpected hyperglycemia, followed by potential hypoglycemia when the pooled insulin is eventually released. Rotating sites prevents the formation of these areas and ensures consistent absorption.\n\n(A) Why it's incorrect: While lipodystrophy can result, the main problem isn't pain (these areas often have decreased sensation), but the effect on insulin absorption.\n\n(B) Why it's incorrect: Superficial hemorrhaging (bruising) is more related to injection technique (e.g., hitting a small blood vessel) than the rotation schedule itself.\n\n(D) Why it's incorrect: This statement is too absolute. Injection sites can be reused, but they must be part of a systematic rotation. The general rule is to keep injections within one anatomic area (e.g., the abdomen) for about a week, rotating spots within that area (staying 1 inch apart), before moving to a new anatomic area (e.g., the thigh).",
    "additional": "Additional Content for Review:\n\nInsulin Injection Sites: The most common and preferred site is the abdomen, as it has the fastest and most consistent absorption rate.

Affects metabolism (glucose), inflammation, and stress response.\n\nMineralocorticoids: Primarily aldosterone. Regulates mineral and water balance.\n\nAndrogens: Sex hormones.\n\n(C) Why it's correct: Aldosterone is the principal mineralocorticoid.

Because water follows sodium, aldosterone also plays a critical role in regulating blood volume and blood pressure.\n\n(A) Why it's incorrect: Cortisol is the principal glucocorticoid.\n\n(B) Why it's incorrect: Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) is produced by the pituitary gland. Its function is to stimulate the adrenal cortex to produce its hormones (especially cortisol). It is a tropic hormone, not a mineralocorticoid.\n\n(D) Why it's incorrect: Epinephrine (adrenaline) is a catecholamine produced by the adrenal medulla, not the adrenal cortex.

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Background: Hyperthyroidism is a condition where the thyroid gland is overactive and produces an excessive amount of thyroid hormones (T3 and T4). This speeds up the body's metabolism. The most common cause is Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder.\n\n(D) Why it's correct: The defining laboratory finding in hyperthyroidism is an elevated level of circulating thyroid hormones (T3 and T4). \"Free\" T3 and T4 refers to the portion of the hormone not bound to protein, which is the biologically active form.\n\n(A) Why it's incorrect: Decreased T3 and T4 levels are characteristic of hypothyroidism.\n\n(B) Why it's incorrect: This involves understanding the HPT axis (Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Thyroid).\n\nHypothalamus releases TRH -> Pituitary releases TSH -> Thyroid releases T3/T4.\n\nT3/T4 exert negative feedback on the hypothalamus and pituitary.\n\nIn primary hyperthyroidism (the problem is in the thyroid itself), the high levels of T3/T4 will suppress the pituitary's release of TSH. TRH from the hypothalamus would also be suppressed. Therefore, you would expect low TSH and low TRH levels.\n\n(C) Why it's incorrect: A Radioactive Iodine Uptake (RAIU) test measures how much iodine the thyroid gland absorbs. In most causes of hyperthyroidism, like Graves' disease, the gland is hyperactive and will show an increased uptake of radioactive iodine. Decreased uptake would be seen in thyroiditis where pre-formed hormone is leaking from an inflamed, non-functioning gland.",

    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Background: Low calcium levels in the blood (hypocalcemia) increase neuromuscular excitability, meaning nerves and muscles become twitchy and prone to spasms. Hypoparathyroidism (underactivity of the parathyroid glands) is a primary cause of hypocalcemia because not enough PTH is produced to maintain calcium levels.\n\n(C) Why it's correct: Chvostek's sign is a classic clinical test for latent tetany associated with hypocalcemia. It is elicited by tapping on the facial nerve (CN VII) just in front of the ear. A positive sign is the twitching of the facial muscles on the same side, such as the corner of the mouth and nose. This directly links the sign to hypocalcemia, which is most commonly caused by hypoparathyroidism.\n\n(A) & (B) Why they are incorrect: Hypercalcemia (high calcium) causes decreased neuromuscular excitability, leading to symptoms like muscle weakness and lethargy, not tetany.\n\n(D) Why it's incorrect: Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid gland) affects metabolism but does not directly cause hypocalcemia. The parathyroid glands, not the thyroid gland, are the primary regulators of calcium. A common reason these two are linked is that the parathyroid glands can be inadvertently damaged or removed during a thyroidectomy, leading to iatrogenic hypoparathyroidism and subsequent hypocalcemia.",

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "(D) Why it's correct: Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder. The body produces abnormal immunoglobulins (antibodies) called thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins (TSIs). These antibodies mimic the action of TSH (Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone). They bind to TSH receptors on the thyroid gland and stimulate it to produce and release excessive amounts of T3 and T4, leading to hyperthyroidism. This is a classic example of an \"immunoglobulins reaction.\" \"Toxic goiter\" refers to a goiter (enlarged thyroid) that is overproducing hormone.\n\n(A) Why it's incorrect: A pituitary tumor that secretes excess TSH can cause hyperthyroidism (this is called secondary hyperthyroidism), but it is a much less common cause than Graves' disease.\n\n(B) Why it's incorrect: A \"benign thyroid\" is not a cause. A benign tumor or nodule on the thyroid can be \"toxic\" and overproduce hormone (toxic nodular goiter), but the most common cause of toxic goiter overall is the autoimmune process of Graves' disease.\n\n(C) Why it's incorrect: Lack of iodine in the diet causes hypothyroidism and a non-toxic goiter. The thyroid enlarges (goiter) as it tries to compensate and trap more iodine from the blood, but it cannot produce hormone without the necessary iodine building block.",

    "question": "Following thyroidectomy, the nurse suspects damage or removal of parathyroid gland when the patient develops:",
    "options": {
      "A": "Muscle weakness and weight loss",
      "B": "Hyperthermia and severe tachycardia",
      "C": "Hypertension and difficulty in swallowing",
      "D": "Laryngeal stridor and tingling in the hands and feet"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Background: The four tiny parathyroid glands are located on the posterior surface of the thyroid gland. During a thyroidectomy, they are at high risk for being accidentally damaged or removed. This leads to hypoparathyroidism and a subsequent drop in serum calcium levels (hypocalcemia).\n\n(D) Why it's correct: This option lists the classic signs of acute, severe hypocalcemia.\n\nTingling in the hands and feet (paresthesia): This is often the earliest symptom of hypocalcemia due to increased nerve excitability.\n\nLaryngeal stridor: This is a high-pitched, harsh sound on inspiration caused by spasm of the laryngeal muscles (laryngospasm). It is a life-threatening sign of severe hypocalcemia (tetany) that can lead to complete airway obstruction. This is a medical emergency.\n\n(A) Why it's incorrect: Muscle weakness and weight loss are non-specific or could be related to hyperthyroidism (pre-op) or hypothyroidism (if thyroid replacement is inadequate post-op), but not acute hypocalcemia.\n\n(B) Why it's incorrect: Hyperthermia and severe tachycardia are signs of a thyroid storm (thyrotoxic crisis), a potential complication before or immediately after surgery if the patient was not adequately prepared. It's caused by a massive release of thyroid hormones, not a lack of parathyroid hormone.\n\n(C) Why it's incorrect: Hypertension is not a sign of hypocalcemia (hypotension can occur). Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) can be due to post-op swelling or laryngeal nerve damage, but it is not as specific for hypocalcemia as tingling and stridor.",
    "additional": "Additional Content for Review:\n\nEmergency Care for Hypocalcemia post-thyroidectomy:\n\nAssess for Chvostek's and Trousseau's signs.\n\nEnsure emergency equipment (tracheostomy tray, suction) is at the bedside.\n\nAdminister IV calcium gluconate or calcium chloride as ordered. This must be given slowly to avoid cardiac complications like hypotension and dysrhythmias.\n\nTextbook Reference: Lewis's Medical-Surgical Nursing, 11th Ed. - Chapter 49 (Endocrine Problems).

    "question": "Increased concentration of red blood cells due to excessive production of erythropoietin is referred to as:",
    "options": {
      "A": "primary polycythemia",
      "B": "leukopenia",
      "C": "secondary polycythemia",
      "D": "agranulocytosis"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Background: Polycythemia is a condition characterized by an increased number of red blood cells (RBCs), resulting in thick blood (increased viscosity). It is important to distinguish between primary and secondary types.\n\n(C) Why it's correct: Secondary polycythemia is when the excess RBC production is caused by a factor outside of the bone marrow. The most common cause is hypoxia. In response to chronic low oxygen levels, the kidneys produce more erythropoietin (EPO), which then stimulates the bone marrow to make more RBCs as a compensatory mechanism. This is seen in people living at high altitudes or those with chronic lung disease (like COPD). It can also be caused by an EPO-secreting tumor. The key is that the increased RBCs are a response to high EPO levels.\n\n(A) Why it's incorrect: Primary polycythemia (also known as polycythemia vera) is a chronic myeloproliferative disorder (a type of blood cancer). The bone marrow itself is abnormal and produces too many RBCs, WBCs, and platelets, independent of EPO levels. In primary polycythemia, EPO levels are typically low or normal due to negative feedback from the high RBC count.\n\n(B) Why it's incorrect: Leukopenia is a decrease in the number of white blood cells.\n\n(D) Why it's incorrect: Agranulocytosis is a severe form of leukopenia, specifically a critical drop in neutrophils, greatly increasing the risk of infection.",

    "question": "To prevent lipodystrophy, a client on insulin is advised to;",
    "options": {
      "a": "Cleanse the skin with alcohol",
      "b": "Aspirate the blood prior to injecting insulin",
      "c": "Rotate the sites of injection",
      "d": "Administer the insulin at a 35 degree angle"
    },
    "answer": "c",
    "explanation": "Correct (c): Lipodystrophy is a change in the subcutaneous fat at the site of repeated insulin injections. It can present as either lipohypertrophy (a buildup of fat, creating a lump) or lipoatrophy (a loss of fat, creating a dimple). Both conditions can interfere with the absorption of insulin, leading to erratic blood glucose control. The single most important technique to prevent this is to systematically rotate injection sites within an anatomical area (e.g., the abdomen) and then rotate to a different anatomical area (e.g., the thigh).\n\nIncorrect (a): Cleansing the skin is important for preventing infection but does not prevent lipodystrophy.\n\nIncorrect (b): Aspirating for blood is no longer recommended for subcutaneous injections like insulin, as there are no large blood vessels in the subcutaneous tissue.\n\nIncorrect (d): The angle of injection (45 to 90 degrees) depends on the patient's amount of subcutaneous fat and the length of the needle, but it is not the primary method for preventing lipodystrophy.",
    "additional": "Deeper Insight: When rotating sites, clients should be taught to use one anatomical area (like the abdomen) for a week, spacing injections about one inch (2.5 cm) apart, before moving to a new area (like the back of the arms). The abdomen is the preferred site because it has the most consistent and rapid absorption rate. A common error is for patients to repeatedly use the same \"favorite\" spot because it becomes less painful, which is precisely what leads to lipohypertrophy.\n\nPossible Next Question (NCK Focus): \"A client with type 1 diabetes who uses the same spot on their thigh for insulin injections complains that their blood sugar has been unpredictably high. The nurse inspects the site and finds a raised, firm area. What is the nurse's best instruction?\" The answer would be \"You need to avoid injecting into this area and rotate your sites to allow the tissue to heal.\""

    "question": "A diet that would be appropriate for a patient with Addison disease is;",
    "options": {
      "a": "High sodium",
      "b": "Low carbohydrate",
      "c": "High potassium",
      "d": "Low protein"
    },
    "answer": "a",
    "explanation": "Correct (a): Addison's disease is primary adrenal insufficiency, meaning the adrenal glands do not produce enough cortisol and, crucially, aldosterone. Aldosterone's main function is to tell the kidneys to retain sodium (and water) and excrete potassium. In its absence, the body loses large amounts of sodium and retains potassium. Therefore, the appropriate diet for a patient with Addison's disease is high in sodium to compensate for the urinary losses.\n\nIncorrect (b, d): Carbohydrate and protein levels are generally not the primary dietary modification, though a diet with adequate glucose is important to prevent hypoglycemia, which can occur due to cortisol deficiency.\n\nIncorrect (c): A diet high in potassium is contraindicated and dangerous. These patients already have a tendency towards hyperkalemia due to the lack of aldosterone, so they should be taught to avoid high-potassium foods.",
    "additional": "Deeper Insight: The treatment for Addison's disease involves lifelong hormone replacement therapy with glucocorticoids (e.g., hydrocortisone, to replace cortisol) and mineralocorticoids (e.g., fludrocortisone, to replace aldosterone). During times of illness, stress, or surgery (an \"Addisonian crisis\"), the body's need for corticosteroids increases dramatically, and the patient will require higher doses of their medication.\n\nPossible Next Question (NCK Focus): \"A client with Addison's disease is being discharged. What is the most important information to include in the teaching plan?\" The answer would be the importance of never abruptly stopping steroid medication and the need for an emergency steroid injection kit. Another potential question: \"A patient with Addison's disease presents with severe hypotension, vomiting, and confusion. The nurse recognizes these as signs of what life-threatening condition?\" The answer is Addisonian crisis."

    "question": "The client with diabetes mellitus reports having difficulty cutting his toe nails. The nurse assesses the toenails and notes the nails are thick and ingrown. Which of the following recommendations should be provided to the client?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Cut the nails straight across with a clipper after the bath.",
      "B": "Make an appointment with a nail shop for a pedicure.",
      "C": "Make an appointment with a podiatrist.",
      "D": "Offer to file the tops of the nails to reduce thickness after cutting."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Proper foot care is critical for clients with diabetes mellitus due to the risks of neuropathy (loss of sensation) and peripheral vascular disease (impaired circulation), which lead to poor healing and a high risk of infection and amputation. When a client has thick, hard, or ingrown toenails, they should never attempt to cut them themselves. The risk of cutting the skin, causing an injury that may not be felt and will not heal well, is too high.\n\nA podiatrist is a healthcare professional who specializes in foot care. They have the appropriate training and sterile equipment to safely manage complex nail issues in high-risk individuals.\n\nCutting nails after a bath (a), while it softens them, is still risky for the client.\n\nA pedicure at a nail shop (b) is strongly contraindicated due to the risk of infection from non-sterile equipment and the lack of specialized training for diabetic feet.\n\nThe nurse or client should not be filing or cutting these nails (d). This requires a specialist.",
    "additional": "Standard Diabetic Foot Care Teaching:\n\nInspect feet daily for any cuts, blisters, redness, or swelling. Use a mirror if needed.\n\nWash feet daily with lukewarm water and mild soap; dry thoroughly, especially between the toes.\n\nApply lotion to the tops and bottoms of feet, but not between the toes (to prevent fungal infection).\n\nNever go barefoot. Wear well-fitting, comfortable shoes and clean, dry socks.\n\nFor routine nail care (if nails are not thick/ingrown), cut straight across and file the edges smooth.\n\nReference: Lewis's Medical-Surgical Nursing, Chapter 48: Diabetes Mellitus."

    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Corns and calluses are areas of thickened skin that develop in response to repeated pressure or friction. The primary cause is ill-fitting footwear that rubs or puts pressure on a specific area of the foot. The best response to a question about prevention is to address the root cause. Teaching the client to select shoes that are properly fitted, with a wide toe box and adequate support, is the most important preventative measure.",
    "additional": "Unsafe Self-Care:\n\nClients with diabetes should never use over-the-counter corn pads or plasters (b), as they contain salicylic acid which can cause a chemical burn on the skin, especially in someone with poor sensation and circulation.\n\nClients should never attempt to cut or shave corns or calluses (c), as this can easily lead to injury and infection.\n\nAbrasive soaps or scrubbing (d) can also damage fragile skin.\n\nProper Management: The client should be advised to see a podiatrist for safe removal of existing corns and for advice on therapeutic footwear.\n\nReference: Brunner & Suddarth's Textbook of Medical-Surgical Nursing, Chapter 43: Assessment and Management of Patients With Diabetes."

    "question": "A client at risk for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus asks why weight loss will reduce risk of the condition. Which of the following responses by the nurse is most correct?",
    "options": {
      "A": "The amount of foods taken in require more insulin to adequately metabolize them, resulting in diabetes.",
      "B": "Excess body weight impairs the body's release of insulin.",
      "C": "Thin people are less likely to become diabetic.",
      "D": "The physical inactivity associated with obesity causes a reduced ability by the body to produce insulin."
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The pathophysiology of Type 2 Diabetes is primarily centered on insulin resistance. In this condition, cells (especially in the liver, muscle, and fat tissue) do not respond effectively to insulin. Excess visceral (abdominal) fat is a major contributor to insulin resistance. Adipose tissue is metabolically active and releases inflammatory substances that interfere with insulin signaling. Over time, the pancreas tries to compensate by producing more and more insulin, but eventually, the beta cells can become exhausted, and insulin production may decrease. Weight loss, particularly of abdominal fat, improves the body's sensitivity to insulin, allowing it to work more effectively and reducing the strain on the pancreas.",
    "additional": "Correction: A more precise answer would be \"Excess body weight causes your cells to become resistant to insulin, making it harder for your body to use the insulin it produces.\" Option 'b' is the closest and most accurate choice provided. Option 'a' is vague. Option 'c' is a generalization and not an explanation. Option 'd' is partially true (inactivity contributes) but less central than the direct effect of adipose tissue on insulin resistance.\n\nRisk Factors for Type 2 DM: Obesity, sedentary lifestyle, family history, race/ethnicity (higher risk in African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, Asian Americans), history of gestational diabetes, hypertension, and high cholesterol.\n\nMetabolic Syndrome: A cluster of conditions (including abdominal obesity, high triglycerides, low HDL, hypertension, and elevated fasting glucose) that significantly increases the risk for Type 2 DM and cardiovascular disease.\n\nReference: Lewis's Medical-Surgical Nursing, Chapter 48: Diabetes Mellitus."

      "D": "Your lab tests indicate the presence of diabetes."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This response directly addresses the client's confusion and provides a physiological rationale for their symptoms (polyphagia and weight loss), which can help break through the denial. In Type 1 Diabetes, there is an absolute lack of insulin. Without insulin, glucose cannot enter the cells to be used for energy. The body is essentially starving at a cellular level, despite high levels of glucose in the blood. This cellular starvation triggers hunger (polyphagia). At the same time, the body starts breaking down its own fat and muscle for energy, leading to weight loss.",
    "additional": "Distractor Rationale:\n\nOption 'a' is true but dismissive and non-therapeutic.\n\nOption 'b' is an overstatement and does not explain the \"why.\"\n\nOption 'd' is confrontational (\"You have it because the tests say so\") and closes down communication.\n\nThe 3 P's of Type 1 Diabetes:\n\nPolyuria: Excessive urination (as the body tries to excrete excess glucose).\n\nPolydipsia: Excessive thirst (due to dehydration from polyuria).\n\nPolyphagia: Excessive hunger (due to cellular starvation).\n\nReference: Brunner & Suddarth's Textbook of Medical-Surgical Nursing, Chapter 43: Assessment and Management of Patients With Diabetes."

      "B": "This client has diabetes.",
      "C": "These results are normal.",

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Megaloblastic anemia is a type of anemia characterized by very large, immature, and dysfunctional red blood cells (megaloblasts) in the bone marrow. It is caused by impaired DNA synthesis, most commonly due to a deficiency in either Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) or Folic Acid (B9).\n\nVitamin B12 is found almost exclusively in animal products (meat, fish, dairy, eggs). Strict vegetarians (vegans) who do not consume any animal products and do not supplement are at very high risk for B12 deficiency.",
    "additional": "Iron deficiency causes microcytic anemia (small, pale red blood cells), not megaloblastic anemia.\n\nZinc and Vitamin C are not directly involved in causing this type of anemia.\n\nGiven the client is a vegetarian, B12 deficiency is the most likely cause of the megaloblastic anemia.\n\nPernicious Anemia: A specific type of megaloblastic anemia caused by the inability to absorb Vitamin B12 due to a lack of intrinsic factor in the stomach. This is an autoimmune condition.\n\nSymptoms of B12 Deficiency: In addition to anemia symptoms (fatigue, pallor, shortness of breath), B12 deficiency can cause irreversible neurological damage, including paresthesias (tingling/numbness in hands and feet), problems with balance, and cognitive changes.\n\nFolic Acid vs. B12: Folic acid can correct the anemia of B12 deficiency but will not correct the neurological damage. It is crucial to differentiate the two.\n\nReference: Lewis's Medical-Surgical Nursing, Chapter 30: Hematologic Problems."
