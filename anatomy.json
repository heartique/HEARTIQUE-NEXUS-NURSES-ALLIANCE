    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "✅ Correct Answer: A) Myasthenia gravis\n\n🧠 Rationale:\nMyasthenia Gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder where antibodies destroy acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. This results in weak neuromuscular transmission and causes muscle weakness that worsens with use.\n\n🧬 A&P + Pathophysiology:\nNeuromuscular transmission requires acetylcholine binding to muscle receptors. In MG, antibodies block or destroy these receptors, impairing muscle contraction.\n\n🏥 Clinical Scenario:\nA 28-year-old teacher experiences ptosis, double vision, and trouble chewing in the evening. Symptoms improve with rest. Diagnosis: Myasthenia Gravis. Treatment includes pyridostigmine and monitoring respiratory function for crisis."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "✅ Correct Answer: B) Neurogenic shock\n\n🧠 Rationale:\nNeurogenic shock results from loss of sympathetic tone due to spinal cord injury above T6. This leads to hypotension and paradoxical bradycardia.\n\n🧬 A&P + Pathophysiology:\nThe sympathetic system controls vessel tone and heart rate. In neurogenic shock, blood vessels dilate and the heart cannot compensate, causing circulatory collapse.\n\n🏥 Clinical Scenario:\nA 22-year-old spinal injury patient’s BP drops from 100/60 to 70/40 with bradycardia when sitting up. As a nurse, lay them flat, give fluids, and prepare vasopressors like norepinephrine. Watch for neurogenic vs autonomic dysreflexia."

      "C": "Minimally conscious state",
      "D": "Locked-in syndrome"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "✅ Correct Answer: B) Vegetative state\n\n✅ Rationale: A vegetative state is a disorder of consciousness where the patient exhibits wakefulness (e.g., eye opening) but no signs of awareness. It occurs due to severe damage to the cerebral cortex, while the brainstem remains intact.\n\n✅ Anatomy & Physiology Expansion: The brainstem, particularly the Ascending Reticular Activating System (ARAS), is responsible for wakefulness. The cerebral cortex governs awareness. In a vegetative state, the ARAS is functional—maintaining sleep-wake cycles and autonomic functions—while the cortex is nonfunctional, leading to a lack of conscious interaction.\n\n✅ Pathophysiology:\n- Coma: No wakefulness or awareness. Both ARAS and cortex are impaired. Eyes remain closed.\n- Vegetative State: Wakefulness present, awareness absent. ARAS intact; cortex severely damaged. Eyes may open; no purposeful response.\n- Minimally Conscious State: Wakefulness with minimal and inconsistent signs of awareness (e.g., visual tracking).\n- Locked-in Syndrome: Full wakefulness and awareness, but complete paralysis (except possibly eye movement) due to ventral brainstem damage.\n\n✅ Unit Expansion Summary: Consciousness is the product of interaction between the brainstem and cerebral cortex. The ARAS 'wakes' the brain, while the cortex interprets, perceives, and responds. When only the ARAS is active, the body may function automatically (breathing, reflexes), but the mind is disconnected."

      "C": "Increased cardiac output",
      "D": "Decreased ventilation rate"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "✅ Correct Answer: C) Increased cardiac output\n\n✅ Rationale: In response to hypoxia (low oxygen), the body attempts to compensate by delivering oxygen more efficiently. One of the immediate responses is increasing cardiac output (HR × SV), which allows more blood—and thus more oxygen—to reach the tissues.\n\n✅ Anatomy & Physiology Expansion: Hypoxia is detected by peripheral chemoreceptors (in the carotid and aortic bodies). They signal the medulla to increase both ventilation rate and heart rate. The cardiovascular system speeds up to circulate available oxygen faster.\n\n✅ Pathophysiology: In the short term, hypoxia increases sympathetic output, leading to tachycardia and increased stroke volume. Over longer periods, hypoxia stimulates the kidneys to release erythropoietin (EPO), which promotes red blood cell (RBC) production, increasing the blood’s oxygen-carrying capacity.\n\n✅ Unit Expansion Summary: Oxygen homeostasis is maintained via both acute and chronic mechanisms. Acute = increased ventilation and cardiac output. Chronic = increased erythropoiesis and angiogenesis."

      "D": "Pleural effusion"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "✅ Correct Answer: A) Acute exacerbation\n\n✅ Rationale: The triad of increased dyspnea, increased sputum volume, and purulent sputum strongly suggests an acute COPD exacerbation, usually triggered by infection or irritants. Coarse crackles support this diagnosis, indicating mucus buildup in the airways.\n\n✅ Anatomy & Physiology Expansion: COPD affects the bronchi (chronic bronchitis) and alveoli (emphysema). Bronchial inflammation increases mucus production and narrows the airways, while alveolar destruction decreases surface area for gas exchange.\n\n✅ Pathophysiology: Exacerbations worsen airway inflammation, mucus hypersecretion, and airflow limitation. This leads to impaired gas exchange, respiratory acidosis, and worsening dyspnea.\n\n✅ Unit Expansion Summary: COPD = Chronic Bronchitis + Emphysema. Exacerbations = increased inflammatory load + worsened obstruction, often due to infection."

      "A": "Autonomic dysreflexia",
      "B": "Neurogenic shock",
      "C": "Spinal shock",
      "D": "Orthostatic hypotension"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "✅ Correct Answer: B) Neurogenic shock\n\n✅ Rationale: Neurogenic shock is common with spinal cord injuries at T6 or above. It results from the sudden loss of sympathetic tone, causing vasodilation (↓ BP) and unopposed vagal tone (↓ HR). Diaphoresis may occur above the level of injury.\n\n✅ Anatomy & Physiology Expansion: The sympathetic nervous system originates from T1–L2 and regulates heart rate and vascular tone. When spinal input is severed at T6 or above, sympathetic control is lost below that level. The vagus nerve (parasympathetic) remains active, slowing the heart.\n\n✅ Pathophysiology: Massive vasodilation → hypotension; unopposed vagal tone → bradycardia. Blood pools in extremities due to loss of vasoconstriction. The hallmark triad: hypotension, bradycardia, and warm skin (vasodilation).\n\n✅ Distinction from Autonomic Dysreflexia: AD is a later complication and involves severe hypertension, not hypotension.\n\n✅ Unit Expansion Summary: Autonomic nervous system imbalance due to spinal trauma leads to distributive shock. Sympathetic loss = ↓ BP and ↓ HR."

    "question": "A patient with chronic kidney disease presents with metabolic acidosis. Which compensatory mechanism is the body most likely to employ to normalize pH?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Hyperventilation",
      "B": "Increased bicarbonate reabsorption",
      "C": "Increased renal excretion of hydrogen ions",
      "D": "Decreased renal excretion of bicarbonate ions"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "✅ Correct Answer: A) Hyperventilation\n\n✅ Rationale: In metabolic acidosis, excess acid or loss of bicarbonate lowers blood pH. The body compensates by increasing ventilation to blow off CO2, which forms carbonic acid. Less CO2 = less acid = higher pH.\n\n✅ Anatomy & Physiology Expansion: The respiratory system is the fastest compensatory system. Central and peripheral chemoreceptors detect low pH and increase respiratory drive, causing deep and rapid breathing (Kussmaul respirations).\n\n✅ Pathophysiology: In chronic kidney disease, the kidneys cannot excrete H+ or regenerate HCO3− effectively. Therefore, the lungs act to correct the imbalance by excreting volatile acid (CO2).\n\n✅ Why Other Options Are Wrong:\n- B, C, and D all involve renal mechanisms, but in CKD, the kidneys are impaired and can't perform these functions effectively.\n\n✅ Unit Expansion Summary: The body maintains pH via two main systems—respiratory (fast) and renal (slow). When the renal system fails, the lungs attempt to compensate via hyperventilation."

      "A": "Type 1 diabetes mellitus",
      "B": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus",
      "C": "Gestational diabetes mellitus",
      "D": "Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA)"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "✅ Correct Answer: A) Type 1 diabetes mellitus\n\n✅ Rationale: The '3 P's'—Polyuria, Polydipsia, and Polyphagia—are classic indicators of uncontrolled hyperglycemia due to insulin deficiency. While these can appear in Type 2 diabetes, their sudden onset is most typical in Type 1 DM.\n\n✅ Physiology of Insulin Deficiency: Without insulin, glucose cannot enter most body cells, so it accumulates in the blood (hyperglycemia). Once glucose exceeds the renal threshold (~180 mg/dL), it spills into urine (glycosuria), drawing water along (polyuria). This fluid loss triggers thirst (polydipsia). Despite high blood glucose, cells are starved, signaling the brain to increase hunger (polyphagia).\n\n✅ Anatomy & Unit Expansion: The pancreas contains Islets of Langerhans. Beta cells secrete insulin (promotes glucose uptake and storage), while alpha cells release glucagon (raises blood sugar). In Type 1 DM, autoimmune destruction of beta cells results in absolute insulin deficiency.\n\n✅ Pathophysiology: In Type 1, the immune system targets beta cells, often triggered by genetic and environmental factors. Type 2 involves insulin resistance. LADA is slow-onset Type 1 in adults, but less likely in acute classic triad cases."

    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "✅ Correct Answer: C) Cirrhosis\n\n✅ Rationale: Cirrhosis is the chronic, irreversible scarring of the liver, often from long-term hepatitis or alcohol use. Jaundice, ascites, spider angiomas, prolonged PT, and low albumin are classic signs of liver failure due to cirrhosis.\n\n✅ Physiology of Liver Failure: Damaged hepatocytes cannot conjugate bilirubin → jaundice. Liver stops producing clotting factors → prolonged PT. Albumin drops → decreased oncotic pressure → ascites. Estrogen buildup from impaired metabolism causes spider angiomas.\n\n✅ Anatomy & Unit Expansion: The liver performs essential roles in metabolism (glucose, fats, proteins), detoxification, storage (glycogen, vitamins), and synthesis (bile, proteins). Cirrhosis involves fibrotic tissue and regenerative nodules replacing normal tissue.\n\n✅ Pathophysiology: Chronic damage → hepatocyte death → fibrosis → portal hypertension → varices, ascites, encephalopathy.

      "C": "Myoglobin",
      "D": "Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "✅ Correct Answer: A) Troponin\n\n✅ Rationale: Troponins I and T are proteins specific to cardiac muscle. Their release into the bloodstream occurs when myocardial cells die during a heart attack. Troponin is both sensitive and specific for detecting myocardial injury.\n\n✅ Physiology: During an MI, ischemia causes necrosis of heart muscle. Damaged myocytes leak their contents, including troponins, into the blood. Troponins remain elevated for several days, allowing detection of recent MI.\n\n✅ Unit Expansion: Troponin is part of the thin filament regulatory complex in sarcomeres. When calcium binds troponin, it changes shape, enabling actin-myosin interaction and contraction.\n\n✅ Pathology: Other markers like CK-MB and myoglobin rise early but are less specific. Myoglobin is present in all muscle. CK-MB is moderately specific but returns to baseline quickly. BNP reflects heart strain or failure, not necrosis."

      "C": "Hemoglobin",
      "D": "Platelet count"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "✅ Correct Answer: C) Hemoglobin\n\n✅ Rationale: ESAs aim to raise hemoglobin by stimulating red blood cell production. Monitoring hemoglobin ensures therapeutic effectiveness and prevents overshooting, which could raise the risk of thrombosis or stroke.\n\n✅ Physiology: Normally, kidneys detect hypoxia and release erythropoietin, which acts on bone marrow to increase erythropoiesis. In CKD, reduced EPO production leads to normocytic normochromic anemia. ESAs mimic natural EPO.\n\n✅ Anatomy & Unit Expansion: Hematopoiesis occurs in red bone marrow. All blood cells arise from pluripotent stem cells. EPO drives myeloid progenitors toward erythrocyte formation. RBC production also requires iron, B12, and folate.\n\n✅ Pathophysiology: ESA therapy corrects anemia symptoms (fatigue, dyspnea) in CKD. Excessive elevation in hemoglobin (>12 g/dL) is linked to cardiovascular events, so levels are maintained within a safe target range."

      "D": "Spleen"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The liver continuously produces bile, a greenish-yellow alkaline fluid. The primary function of bile is the emulsification of fats—breaking large fat globules into smaller droplets. This dramatically increases the surface area for the fat-digesting enzyme, pancreatic lipase, to work. The gallbladder's role is to store and concentrate the bile produced by the liver, releasing it into the small intestine when fat is consumed.\n\nUnit Expansion Summary: Biliary System\n\nProduction: Hepatocytes in the liver produce bile.\n\nPathway: Bile flows from the liver through the hepatic ducts, which join to form the common hepatic duct.\n\nStorage: The common hepatic duct connects to the cystic duct, which leads to the gallbladder. Bile backs up into the gallbladder for storage and concentration.\n\nSecretion: When fatty food enters the duodenum, the hormone cholecystokinin (CCK) is released, causing the gallbladder to contract and release bile through the cystic duct, into the common bile duct, and finally into the duodenum.\n\nPancreatic Connection: The common bile duct usually joins the main pancreatic duct before entering the duodenum at the hepatopancreatic ampulla (of Vater)."

    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Excellent. Let's move into the Immunology section. These questions focus on the cells, processes, and types of immunity.\n\nQuestion 301: Type of Immunity\n\nExposure to a pathogen like HBV triggers an active immune response. Specifically, humoral immunity involves B-lymphocytes (B-cells) that recognize the virus and differentiate into plasma cells. These plasma cells produce antibodies (like anti-HBs) that circulate in the body's fluids (\"humors\"). These antibodies can neutralize the virus upon re-exposure, preventing it from infecting cells. The response also creates memory B-cells, which provide long-lasting protection.\n\nUnit Expansion Summary: Types of Acquired Immunity\n\nActive Immunity: The body produces its own antibodies. It is long-lasting due to memory cells.\n\nNaturally Acquired: Develops after infection with a pathogen (e.g., getting chickenpox).\n\nArtificially Acquired: Develops after receiving a vaccination (e.g., MMR vaccine).\n\nPassive Immunity: The body receives pre-made antibodies from another source. It is temporary as the antibodies are eventually broken down.\n\nNaturally Acquired: An infant receives antibodies from the mother through the placenta (IgG) or breast milk (IgA).\n\nArtificially Acquired: A person receives an injection of antibodies (immunoglobulins), e.g., for rabies or tetanus exposure."

    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Question 302: Antigen Presentation\n\nAntigen-Presenting Cells (APCs) are crucial for initiating the adaptive immune response. Macrophages are phagocytes (\"big eaters\") that engulf pathogens. They then process the pathogen and display a piece of it (an antigen) on their surface using Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II molecules. This antigen-MHC complex is then \"presented\" to a helper T-cell, which activates the T-cell and orchestrates a larger immune response.\n\nUnit Expansion Summary: Key Cells of the Immune System\n\nPhagocytes (Innate):\n\nNeutrophils: Most abundant WBC; first responders to bacterial infection.\n\nMacrophages: Engulf pathogens, cellular debris, and act as APCs.\n\nLymphocytes (Adaptive):\n\nB-Cells: Responsible for humoral immunity. Differentiate into plasma cells to make antibodies.\n\nT-Cells: Responsible for cell-mediated immunity.\n\nHelper T-Cells (CD4+): The \"generals.\" They coordinate the immune response by activating B-cells and cytotoxic T-cells.\n\nCytotoxic T-Cells (CD8+): The \"soldiers.\" They directly kill virus-infected cells and tumor cells.\n\nOther Key Cells:\n\nNK Cells (Innate): Can kill infected cells and tumor cells without prior sensitization.\n\nDendritic Cells: The most potent type of APC.\n\nMast Cells/Basophils: Release histamine during allergic reactions."

      "D": "Neutralization of toxins"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Question 303: C-Reactive Protein (CRP)\n\nC-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute-phase protein produced by the liver in response to inflammation (especially driven by the cytokine IL-6). One of its primary roles is to act as an opsonin. Opsonization is the process of coating a pathogen with proteins that make it more \"tasty\" or recognizable to phagocytes. CRP binds to the surface of bacteria, marking them for destruction by macrophages and neutrophils.\n\nUnit Expansion Summary: Opsonization and the Complement System\n\nOpsonization: A key process that bridges innate and adaptive immunity. The goal is to flag a pathogen for phagocytosis.\n\nMajor Opsonins: Antibodies (IgG) from the adaptive system and Complement proteins (like C3b) and CRP from the innate system.\n\nThe Complement System: A cascade of ~30 plasma proteins that \"complement\" the immune response.\n\nKey Functions:\n\nOpsonization (C3b): Coats pathogens.\n\nInflammation (C3a, C5a): Attracts phagocytes to the area.\n\nCytolysis (Membrane Attack Complex - MAC): Forms a pore in the pathogen's membrane, causing it to burst."

      "D": "Memory T cells"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Question 304: Regulatory T-Cells\n\nThe immune system needs \"brakes\" to prevent it from over-reacting and damaging healthy tissue or attacking itself (autoimmunity). Regulatory T-cells (Tregs) are the primary suppressors. They produce inhibitory cytokines and directly inhibit the function of other immune cells, like helper T-cells and cytotoxic T-cells, effectively shutting down the immune response once a threat is cleared and maintaining self-tolerance."

    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Question 305: Immunological Memory\n\nDuring a primary immune response, some activated B-cells and T-cells do not become short-lived effector cells (like plasma cells or cytotoxic T-cells). Instead, they become long-lived memory cells.\n\nPhysiology: Upon a second encounter with the same antigen, these memory cells are more numerous and more easily activated than the original naive cells. They undergo rapid clonal expansion (proliferation), quickly generating a massive population of plasma cells that produce a high-affinity antibody response. This secondary response is much faster, stronger, and longer-lasting than the primary response."

    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Understood. Continuing with the Immunology section.\n\nQuestion 306: Neutrophil Function\n\nNeutrophils are professional phagocytes. Their primary function is to engulf and destroy pathogens, especially bacteria and fungi. They follow chemical signals to the site of infection (chemotaxis), adhere to the pathogen, ingest it into a vesicle called a phagosome, and then destroy it using enzymes and reactive oxygen species. Impaired neutrophil function directly translates to impaired phagocytosis.\n\nUnit Expansion Summary: Key Functions of Immune Cells (Recap)\n\nPhagocytosis: Neutrophils, Macrophages.\nAntibody Production: B-cells differentiate into Plasma Cells.\nCytokine Secretion: Many cells, but especially Helper T-cells (to coordinate) and Macrophages (to inflame).\nMast Cell Degranulation: Releases histamine for allergic responses."

    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Question 307: Natural Killer (NK) Cells\n\nNK cells are a type of cytotoxic lymphocyte that is part of the innate immune system. Unlike cytotoxic T-cells (which are adaptive), NK cells do not need prior sensitization to an antigen. They are constantly \"patrolling\" and are programmed to recognize and kill cells that are missing a \"self\" marker (MHC class I molecules), a common feature of many virus-infected cells and tumor cells. They kill their targets by releasing proteins (perforin and granzymes) that induce apoptosis (programmed cell death)."

    "explanation": "Question 309: Allergic Response\n\nThe Type I hypersensitivity reaction (classic allergy) is mediated by mast cells (found in tissues) and basophils (found in blood).\n\nPhysiology of Allergy:\n\nSensitization: On first exposure to an allergen, B-cells are stimulated (by Th2 cells) to produce IgE antibodies. This IgE then attaches to the surface of mast cells.\n\nActivation: On a subsequent exposure, the allergen binds directly to the IgE on the mast cell surface.\n\nDegranulation: This binding triggers the mast cell to rapidly release its granules, which contain potent inflammatory mediators like histamine. Histamine causes vasodilation (redness), increased vascular permeability (swelling/hives), and smooth muscle contraction (bronchoconstriction/difficulty breathing)."

    "explanation": "This triad of symptoms is the hallmark of diabetes mellitus. It is caused by high blood glucose levels due to insulin deficiency or resistance. Polyuria occurs because glucose spills into the urine, drawing water with it. This leads to dehydration, causing polydipsia (thirst). Since cells cannot access glucose properly, the body signals hunger (polyphagia) despite the hyperglycemia."

    "question": "A patient presents with weight gain, cold intolerance, bradycardia, and constipation. Laboratory tests reveal elevated TSH and decreased free T4. Which endocrine disorder is most likely responsible for these symptoms?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Hyperthyroidism",
      "B": "Hypothyroidism",
      "C": "Diabetes mellitus",
      "D": "Addison's disease"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This is classic primary hypothyroidism. The thyroid gland fails to produce enough T4, resulting in a slow metabolic rate. The pituitary compensates by increasing TSH production. Common symptoms include fatigue, cold intolerance, slow heart rate, weight gain, and constipation. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most common cause."

    "question": "A patient presents with weight loss, heat intolerance, palpitations, and exophthalmos. Lab results show suppressed TSH and elevated free T4. What is the most likely endocrine disorder?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Hyperthyroidism",
      "B": "Hypothyroidism",
      "C": "Diabetes mellitus",
      "D": "Addison's disease"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This describes primary hyperthyroidism, most often caused by Graves' disease. Excess T4 leads to a high metabolic rate, which suppresses TSH. Exophthalmos is a unique sign of Graves’ disease due to autoimmune inflammation of orbital tissues. Symptoms reflect a hypermetabolic state."

    "question": "A patient presents with central obesity, moon face, buffalo hump, and purple striae. Lab tests show elevated cortisol levels. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Hyperthyroidism",
      "B": "Hypothyroidism",
      "C": "Diabetes mellitus",
      "D": "Cushing's syndrome"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Cushing’s syndrome results from prolonged exposure to excess cortisol. Cortisol increases blood glucose and redistributes fat to the face, neck, and trunk. It also weakens skin structure, leading to purple striae. High cortisol can result from exogenous steroids or tumors producing ACTH or cortisol."
  },
  {
    "question": "A patient presents with fatigue, weakness, constipation, and darkened skin. Lab results show low cortisol and high ACTH. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Hyperthyroidism",
      "B": "Hypothyroidism",
      "C": "Diabetes mellitus",
      "D": "Addison's disease"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Addison’s disease is primary adrenal insufficiency. The adrenal glands can't produce cortisol. Low cortisol leads to fatigue, hypotension, and GI symptoms. High ACTH (from the pituitary trying to compensate) also increases MSH production, causing hyperpigmentation of the skin."

    "question": "A patient presents with delayed puberty, short stature, and a childlike appearance. Labs show low GH and low IGF-1. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Hyperthyroidism",
      "B": "Hypothyroidism",
      "C": "Diabetes mellitus",
      "D": "Growth hormone deficiency"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Growth hormone deficiency causes reduced stimulation of IGF-1, which is essential for linear growth. GH and IGF-1 promote bone and cartilage development. A deficiency results in short stature, delayed puberty, and increased fat with a cherubic appearance."

  {
    "question": "A patient presents with excessive thirst and passes large amounts of dilute urine. Lab tests show hypernatremia and high serum osmolality. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Hyperthyroidism",
      "B": "Hypothyroidism",
      "C": "Diabetes mellitus",
      "D": "Diabetes insipidus"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Diabetes insipidus is due to a lack of or resistance to ADH. Without ADH, the kidneys can’t reabsorb water, resulting in large amounts of dilute urine. This water loss leads to concentrated blood (high serum osmolality and sodium), causing intense thirst."

  {
    "question": "During the postpartum assessment, a new mother reports experiencing mild cramping and uterine contractions while breastfeeding. What physiological process is responsible for these symptoms?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Prolactin release",
      "B": "Oxytocin release",
      "C": "Estrogen surge",
      "D": "Progesterone withdrawal"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "These postpartum cramps, known as 'afterpains,' are caused by oxytocin release. When the baby suckles, sensory nerves in the nipple send signals to the hypothalamus. This leads to the release of oxytocin from the posterior pituitary. Oxytocin has two effects: it causes milk ejection (the let-down reflex), and it stimulates uterine muscle contraction. These contractions reduce bleeding and help the uterus return to its pre-pregnancy size."
