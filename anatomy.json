    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "‚úÖ Correct Answer: C) Increased cardiac output\n\nüß† Rationale:\nThe body increases cardiac output to circulate oxygenated blood faster to tissues when oxygen levels are low.\n\nüß¨ A&P + Pathophysiology:\nChronic hypoxia triggers the kidneys to release erythropoietin, increasing RBC production. It also raises heart rate and stroke volume, increasing oxygen delivery.\n\nüè• Clinical Scenario:\nA COPD patient with clubbed fingers, elevated resting HR, and high hematocrit shows signs of compensation. This adaptation helps maintain oxygenation but increases strain on the heart, possibly leading to cor pulmonale."

Coarse crackles indicate airway obstruction by mucus.\n\nüß¨ A&P + Pathophysiology:\nIn COPD, inflammation narrows airways and damages alveoli. Exacerbations worsen this inflammation, causing severe airflow limitation and poor gas exchange.\n\nüè• Clinical Scenario:\nMr. Kamau, a COPD patient, presents with worsening breathlessness and green sputum. He needs oxygen (target 88‚Äì92%), bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics. Nursing care includes sputum monitoring and breathing support."

    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "‚úÖ Correct Answer: B) Neurogenic shock\n\nüß† Rationale:\nNeurogenic shock results from loss of sympathetic tone due to spinal cord injury above T6. This leads to hypotension and paradoxical bradycardia.\n\nüß¨ A&P + Pathophysiology:\nThe sympathetic system controls vessel tone and heart rate. In neurogenic shock, blood vessels dilate and the heart cannot compensate, causing circulatory collapse.\n\nüè• Clinical Scenario:\nA 22-year-old spinal injury patient‚Äôs BP drops from 100/60 to 70/40 with bradycardia when sitting up. As a nurse, lay them flat, give fluids, and prepare vasopressors like norepinephrine. Watch for neurogenic vs autonomic dysreflexia."

      "C": "Minimally conscious state",
      "D": "Locked-in syndrome"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "‚úÖ Correct Answer: B) Vegetative state\n\n‚úÖ Rationale: A vegetative state is a disorder of consciousness where the patient exhibits wakefulness (e.g., eye opening) but no signs of awareness. It occurs due to severe damage to the cerebral cortex, while the brainstem remains intact.\n\n‚úÖ Anatomy & Physiology Expansion: The brainstem, particularly the Ascending Reticular Activating System (ARAS), is responsible for wakefulness. The cerebral cortex governs awareness. In a vegetative state, the ARAS is functional‚Äîmaintaining sleep-wake cycles and autonomic functions‚Äîwhile the cortex is nonfunctional, leading to a lack of conscious interaction.\n\n‚úÖ Pathophysiology:\n- Coma: No wakefulness or awareness. Both ARAS and cortex are impaired. Eyes remain closed.\n- Vegetative State: Wakefulness present, awareness absent. ARAS intact; cortex severely damaged. Eyes may open; no purposeful response.\n- Minimally Conscious State: Wakefulness with minimal and inconsistent signs of awareness (e.g., visual tracking).\n- Locked-in Syndrome: Full wakefulness and awareness, but complete paralysis (except possibly eye movement) due to ventral brainstem damage.\n\n‚úÖ Unit Expansion Summary: Consciousness is the product of interaction between the brainstem and cerebral cortex. The ARAS 'wakes' the brain, while the cortex interprets, perceives, and responds. When only the ARAS is active, the body may function automatically (breathing, reflexes), but the mind is disconnected."

      "D": "Decreased ventilation rate"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "‚úÖ Correct Answer: C) Increased cardiac output\n\n‚úÖ Rationale: In response to hypoxia (low oxygen), the body attempts to compensate by delivering oxygen more efficiently. One of the immediate responses is increasing cardiac output (HR √ó SV), which allows more blood‚Äîand thus more oxygen‚Äîto reach the tissues.\n\n‚úÖ Anatomy & Physiology Expansion: Hypoxia is detected by peripheral chemoreceptors (in the carotid and aortic bodies). They signal the medulla to increase both ventilation rate and heart rate. The cardiovascular system speeds up to circulate available oxygen faster.\n\n‚úÖ Pathophysiology: In the short term, hypoxia increases sympathetic output, leading to tachycardia and increased stroke volume. Over longer periods, hypoxia stimulates the kidneys to release erythropoietin (EPO), which promotes red blood cell (RBC) production, increasing the blood‚Äôs oxygen-carrying capacity.\n\n‚úÖ Unit Expansion Summary: Oxygen homeostasis is maintained via both acute and chronic mechanisms. Acute = increased ventilation and cardiac output. Chronic = increased erythropoiesis and angiogenesis."

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "‚úÖ Correct Answer: A) Acute exacerbation\n\n‚úÖ Rationale: The triad of increased dyspnea, increased sputum volume, and purulent sputum strongly suggests an acute COPD exacerbation, usually triggered by infection or irritants. Coarse crackles support this diagnosis, indicating mucus buildup in the airways.\n\n‚úÖ Anatomy & Physiology Expansion: COPD affects the bronchi (chronic bronchitis) and alveoli (emphysema). Bronchial inflammation increases mucus production and narrows the airways, while alveolar destruction decreases surface area for gas exchange.\n\n‚úÖ Pathophysiology: Exacerbations worsen airway inflammation, mucus hypersecretion, and airflow limitation. This leads to impaired gas exchange, respiratory acidosis, and worsening dyspnea.\n\n‚úÖ Unit Expansion Summary: COPD = Chronic Bronchitis + Emphysema. Exacerbations = increased inflammatory load + worsened obstruction, often due to infection."

    "options": {
      "A": "Autonomic dysreflexia",
      "B": "Neurogenic shock",
      "C": "Spinal shock",
      "D": "Orthostatic hypotension"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "‚úÖ Correct Answer: B) Neurogenic shock\n\n‚úÖ Rationale: Neurogenic shock is common with spinal cord injuries at T6 or above. It results from the sudden loss of sympathetic tone, causing vasodilation (‚Üì BP) and unopposed vagal tone (‚Üì HR). Diaphoresis may occur above the level of injury.\n\n‚úÖ Anatomy & Physiology Expansion: The sympathetic nervous system originates from T1‚ÄìL2 and regulates heart rate and vascular tone. When spinal input is severed at T6 or above, sympathetic control is lost below that level. The vagus nerve (parasympathetic) remains active, slowing the heart.\n\n‚úÖ Pathophysiology: Massive vasodilation ‚Üí hypotension; unopposed vagal tone ‚Üí bradycardia. Blood pools in extremities due to loss of vasoconstriction. The hallmark triad: hypotension, bradycardia, and warm skin (vasodilation).\n\n‚úÖ Distinction from Autonomic Dysreflexia: AD is a later complication and involves severe hypertension, not hypotension.\n\n‚úÖ Unit Expansion Summary: Autonomic nervous system imbalance due to spinal trauma leads to distributive shock. Sympathetic loss = ‚Üì BP and ‚Üì HR."

    "question": "A patient with chronic kidney disease presents with metabolic acidosis. Which compensatory mechanism is the body most likely to employ to normalize pH?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Hyperventilation",
      "B": "Increased bicarbonate reabsorption",
      "C": "Increased renal excretion of hydrogen ions",
      "D": "Decreased renal excretion of bicarbonate ions"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "‚úÖ Correct Answer: A) Hyperventilation\n\n‚úÖ Rationale: In metabolic acidosis, excess acid or loss of bicarbonate lowers blood pH. The body compensates by increasing ventilation to blow off CO2, which forms carbonic acid. Less CO2 = less acid = higher pH.\n\n‚úÖ Anatomy & Physiology Expansion: The respiratory system is the fastest compensatory system. Central and peripheral chemoreceptors detect low pH and increase respiratory drive, causing deep and rapid breathing (Kussmaul respirations).\n\n‚úÖ Pathophysiology: In chronic kidney disease, the kidneys cannot excrete H+ or regenerate HCO3‚àí effectively. Therefore, the lungs act to correct the imbalance by excreting volatile acid (CO2).\n\n‚úÖ Why Other Options Are Wrong:\n- B, C, and D all involve renal mechanisms, but in CKD, the kidneys are impaired and can't perform these functions effectively.\n\n‚úÖ Unit Expansion Summary: The body maintains pH via two main systems‚Äîrespiratory (fast) and renal (slow). When the renal system fails, the lungs attempt to compensate via hyperventilation."

      "A": "Type 1 diabetes mellitus",
      "B": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus",
      "C": "Gestational diabetes mellitus",
      "D": "Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA)"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "‚úÖ Correct Answer: A) Type 1 diabetes mellitus\n\n‚úÖ Rationale: The '3 P's'‚ÄîPolyuria, Polydipsia, and Polyphagia‚Äîare classic indicators of uncontrolled hyperglycemia due to insulin deficiency. While these can appear in Type 2 diabetes, their sudden onset is most typical in Type 1 DM.\n\n‚úÖ Physiology of Insulin Deficiency: Without insulin, glucose cannot enter most body cells, so it accumulates in the blood (hyperglycemia). Once glucose exceeds the renal threshold (~180 mg/dL), it spills into urine (glycosuria), drawing water along (polyuria). This fluid loss triggers thirst (polydipsia). Despite high blood glucose, cells are starved, signaling the brain to increase hunger (polyphagia).\n\n‚úÖ Anatomy & Unit Expansion: The pancreas contains Islets of Langerhans. Beta cells secrete insulin (promotes glucose uptake and storage), while alpha cells release glucagon (raises blood sugar). In Type 1 DM, autoimmune destruction of beta cells results in absolute insulin deficiency.\n\n‚úÖ Pathophysiology: In Type 1, the immune system targets beta cells, often triggered by genetic and environmental factors. Type 2 involves insulin resistance. LADA is slow-onset Type 1 in adults, but less likely in acute classic triad cases."

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "‚úÖ Correct Answer: C) Cirrhosis\n\n‚úÖ Rationale: Cirrhosis is the chronic, irreversible scarring of the liver, often from long-term hepatitis or alcohol use. Jaundice, ascites, spider angiomas, prolonged PT, and low albumin are classic signs of liver failure due to cirrhosis.\n\n‚úÖ Physiology of Liver Failure: Damaged hepatocytes cannot conjugate bilirubin ‚Üí jaundice. Liver stops producing clotting factors ‚Üí prolonged PT. Albumin drops ‚Üí decreased oncotic pressure ‚Üí ascites. Estrogen buildup from impaired metabolism causes spider angiomas.\n\n‚úÖ Anatomy & Unit Expansion: The liver performs essential roles in metabolism (glucose, fats, proteins), detoxification, storage (glycogen, vitamins), and synthesis (bile, proteins). Cirrhosis involves fibrotic tissue and regenerative nodules replacing normal tissue.\n\n‚úÖ Pathophysiology: Chronic damage ‚Üí hepatocyte death ‚Üí fibrosis ‚Üí portal hypertension ‚Üí varices, ascites, encephalopathy.

      "C": "Myoglobin",
      "D": "Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "‚úÖ Correct Answer: A) Troponin\n\n‚úÖ Rationale: Troponins I and T are proteins specific to cardiac muscle. Their release into the bloodstream occurs when myocardial cells die during a heart attack. Troponin is both sensitive and specific for detecting myocardial injury.\n\n‚úÖ Physiology: During an MI, ischemia causes necrosis of heart muscle. Damaged myocytes leak their contents, including troponins, into the blood. Troponins remain elevated for several days, allowing detection of recent MI.\n\n‚úÖ Unit Expansion: Troponin is part of the thin filament regulatory complex in sarcomeres. When calcium binds troponin, it changes shape, enabling actin-myosin interaction and contraction.\n\n‚úÖ Pathology: Other markers like CK-MB and myoglobin rise early but are less specific. Myoglobin is present in all muscle. CK-MB is moderately specific but returns to baseline quickly. BNP reflects heart strain or failure, not necrosis."

      "C": "Hemoglobin",
      "D": "Platelet count"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "‚úÖ Correct Answer: C) Hemoglobin\n\n‚úÖ Rationale: ESAs aim to raise hemoglobin by stimulating red blood cell production. Monitoring hemoglobin ensures therapeutic effectiveness and prevents overshooting, which could raise the risk of thrombosis or stroke.\n\n‚úÖ Physiology: Normally, kidneys detect hypoxia and release erythropoietin, which acts on bone marrow to increase erythropoiesis. In CKD, reduced EPO production leads to normocytic normochromic anemia. ESAs mimic natural EPO.\n\n‚úÖ Anatomy & Unit Expansion: Hematopoiesis occurs in red bone marrow. All blood cells arise from pluripotent stem cells. EPO drives myeloid progenitors toward erythrocyte formation. RBC production also requires iron, B12, and folate.\n\n‚úÖ Pathophysiology: ESA therapy corrects anemia symptoms (fatigue, dyspnea) in CKD. Excessive elevation in hemoglobin (>12 g/dL) is linked to cardiovascular events, so levels are maintained within a safe target range."
