      "B": "Anemia",
      "C": "Hypotension",
      "D": "Hypocalcemia"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Patients with ESRD are unable to excrete sodium and water effectively. This leads to chronic fluid volume excess, which is a primary cause of hypertension. Therefore, hypotension would not be an expected finding unless the patient was experiencing a separate acute event like sepsis or hemorrhage.",
    "additional": "Why A, B, and D are incorrect:\nA. Edema: Caused by fluid volume excess.\nB. Anemia: In ESRD, erythropoietin production ceases, leading to chronic anemia.\nD. Hypocalcemia: Due to failure to activate Vitamin D, which reduces calcium absorption.\n\nAdditional Possible Content to be Tested Next:\n- Hyperkalemia: Due to decreased excretion of potassium.\n- Hyperphosphatemia: Due to decreased excretion of phosphate.\n- Metabolic Acidosis: Inability to excrete hydrogen ions.\n- Uremia: Accumulation of nitrogenous waste causing pruritus, nausea, encephalopathy."

      "C": "Early clinical indicators of shock",
      "D": "Fall in sympathetic nervous system discharge"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The initial vital signs (tachycardia, hypertension, tachypnea) are typical of sympathetic nervous system activation in response to stress or pain. Cleansing and reassurance lowered anxiety, which reduced the stimulus for this response. As a result, sympathetic discharge decreased and parasympathetic tone was restored, leading to normalization of the client's vital signs.",
    "additional": "Why A, B, and C are incorrect:\nA & B: Environmental effects like cooling or air conditioning would not produce rapid, system-wide changes in vitals.\nC: Shock involves worsening vital signs such as increasing tachycardia and falling blood pressure. This client’s vitals improved.\n\nAdditional Possible Content to be Tested Next:\n- Sympathetic Nervous System: Triggers fight-or-flight, increases HR, BP, RR.\n- Parasympathetic Nervous System: Calms the body, lowers HR and RR, enhances digestion.\n- Nursing Techniques for Anxiety Reduction: Reassurance, calm communication, deep breathing, and environment control."

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "A prominent U wave is the hallmark EKG finding of hypokalemia, not hyperkalemia. This makes it the correct 'except' answer in the context of hyperkalemia-related changes.",
    "additional": "Why A, B, and D are incorrect:\n- A: Tall peaked T waves are the earliest sign of hyperkalemia.\n- B & D: As potassium increases, P waves flatten and may disappear, and the QRS complex widens.\n\nIf left untreated, these changes progress to a sine wave pattern that precedes cardiac arrest.\n\nMore on Hyperkalemia:\n- Causes: Renal failure, potassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, tissue damage (e.g., rhabdomyolysis).\n- Symptoms: Muscle weakness, flaccid paralysis, cardiac arrhythmias.\n- Emergency Treatment (Mnemonic: C BIG K DiE):\n  • Calcium gluconate to stabilize the cardiac membrane.\n  • Beta-agonist or bicarbonate to shift K+ intracellularly.\n  • Insulin and glucose to drive K+ into cells.\n  • Kayexalate or diuretics to remove K+.\n  • Dialysis for definitive treatment."

      "D": "Assess the fistula for the presence of a bruit and thrill every 4 hours"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The nurse must assess the AV fistula regularly to ensure it remains patent. Palpating for a thrill and auscultating for a bruit every 4 hours helps identify thrombosis early, which can prevent access failure. This is a vital safety intervention in clients undergoing hemodialysis.",
    "additional": "Why A, B, and C are incorrect:\n- A & B: Never use the fistula arm for BP, IVs, or blood draws. This risks clotting or damaging the access.\n- C: Clamps should never be attached to an AV fistula dressing as this can interfere with flow.\n\nMore on AV Access:\n- Fistula: Direct connection of an artery and vein. Preferred for long-term use.\n- Graft: Synthetic tube between artery and vein. Used when veins are unsuitable.\n\nPatient Education:\n- Avoid tight clothing or jewelry on the access arm.\n- Don’t sleep on the access arm.\n- Report absence of thrill, redness, or pain immediately.\n- No BP, IVs, or blood draws on the access side."

    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Rationale for the Correct Answer (C): The key findings are a new systolic murmur heard at the cardiac apex in a client who recently had a myocardial infarction (MI).\n\nThe cardiac apex (usually the 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line) is the best location to auscultate the mitral valve.\n\nA systolic murmur heard here indicates mitral regurgitation—blood is leaking backward from the left ventricle into the left atrium during ventricular contraction (systole).\n\nAn MI can cause ischemia and necrosis of the papillary muscles, which are responsible for holding the leaflets of the mitral valve closed during systole. When these muscles are damaged or rupture, they can no longer do their job, leading to acute, severe mitral regurgitation. This is a life-threatening mechanical complication of an MI. The nurse must assess for signs of pulmonary edema (dyspnea, crackles) and cardiogenic shock (hypotension, tachycardia, decreased urine output) and notify the provider immediately.",
    "additional": "Why Other Options are Incorrect:\n\nA: Ventricular aneurysm is a late complication of MI (weeks to months later) and does not typically cause a new systolic murmur at the apex shortly after an MI.\n\nB: Acute pericarditis typically presents with a pericardial friction rub and sharp chest pain, not a murmur. The pain is usually relieved by leaning forward.\n\nD: Pulmonary embolism does not cause a murmur at the apex and presents with dyspnea, pleuritic pain, and tachycardia.\n\nAdditional Content & Potential Future Questions:\n\nKey Complications of Myocardial Infarction:\n\n1.

      "A": "Ventricular aneurysm",
      "B": "Acute pericarditis",
      "C": "Papillary muscle dysfunction",
      "D": "Pulmonary embolism"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The key components in the question are a recent MI, a new systolic murmur, and its location at the cardiac apex. This clinical picture is a classic sign of acute mitral regurgitation caused by papillary muscle dysfunction or rupture.\n\nPathophysiology: The papillary muscles are attached to the mitral valve leaflets via the chordae tendineae. They contract during systole to prevent the valve from prolapsing back into the left atrium. An MI, particularly one affecting the inferior or posterior walls of the heart, can disrupt the blood supply to these muscles, causing them to become ischemic and dysfunctional, or even to rupture.\n\nResulting Murmur: When the papillary muscle is dysfunctional, the mitral valve cannot close completely during ventricular contraction (systole). This allows a jet of blood to flow backward (regurgitate) from the high-pressure left ventricle into the lower-pressure left atrium. This turbulent backflow is what creates the 'whooshing' sound of a new, loud systolic murmur, which is best auscultated at the cardiac apex (the location of the mitral valve, typically the 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line). This is a serious, often life-threatening complication that leads to acute pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock.\n\nRationale for Incorrect Options:\n\n(A) Ventricular aneurysm: This is a late complication of an MI, typically occurring weeks to months later. It is a thinned, bulging section of the ventricular wall that can impair contractility but does not characteristically cause a new, acute systolic murmur at the apex.\n\n(B) Acute pericarditis: This is inflammation of the pericardial sac, which can occur 2 to 3 days post-MI. Its hallmark sign is a pericardial friction rub, a scratching, grating, high-pitched sound, not a systolic murmur. The pain is also characteristic—sharp, pleuritic, and often relieved by leaning forward.\n\n(D) Pulmonary embolism: This involves a clot obstructing the pulmonary artery. It presents with sudden dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, and tachycardia. It does not cause a murmur at the cardiac apex.",
    "additional": "Immediate Nursing Action: After identifying this new murmur, the nurse's priority is to assess for signs of cardiogenic shock and pulmonary edema. This includes checking for hypotension, tachycardia, crackles on lung auscultation, dyspnea, and confusion. The nurse must notify the physician immediately, as this is a surgical emergency.\n\nOther Mechanical Complications of MI:\n\n- Ventricular Septal Rupture: Causes a new, loud, harsh holosystolic murmur heard at the left sternal border. It leads to a left-to-right shunt, causing severe heart failure.\n- Cardiac Rupture: A catastrophic event leading to cardiac tamponade and rapid clinical deterioration.\n\nOther General Complications of MI:\n\n- Dysrhythmias (most common)\n- Heart failure\n- Cardiogenic shock\n\nBrunner & Suddarth's Textbook of Medical-Surgical Nursing (14th Ed.)

      "A": "Exercise",
      "B": "obesity",
      "C": "stress",
      "D": "heredity"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Risk factors for diseases are categorized as either modifiable (controllable) or non-modifiable (uncontrollable).\n\nNon-modifiable (Uncontrollable) Risk Factors: These are factors that a person cannot change. Heredity, or family history, is a primary non-modifiable risk factor for CAD. Having a first-degree relative (parent, sibling) with cardiovascular disease at an early age (before 55 for men, before 65 for women) significantly increases an individual's own risk.\n\nModifiable (Controllable) Risk Factors: These are lifestyle factors and conditions that a person can take measures to change or manage.\n\nRationale for Incorrect Options:\n\n(A) Exercise: Lack of exercise (physical inactivity) is a modifiable risk factor. Increasing exercise helps control weight, blood pressure, and cholesterol.\n\n(B) obesity: Obesity is a significant modifiable risk factor. Weight loss can dramatically reduce the risk of CAD.\n\n(C) stress: While difficult to manage, stress is considered a modifiable risk factor. Patients can learn coping mechanisms and relaxation techniques to reduce its impact.",

      "B": "Impaired skin integrity related to pressure",
      "C": "Activity intolerance related to pump failure",
      "D": "Constipation related to immobility"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "If we must choose from the given options, (C) Activity intolerance related to pump failure is a significant issue. However, acute pulmonary edema is a life-threatening situation where breathing is the primary concern. The true priority diagnosis would be Impaired Gas Exchange. Since it's not an option, we must re-evaluate. Let's analyze the options as they are written.\n\n(C) Activity intolerance is certainly a correct diagnosis for heart failure. The failing pump cannot supply enough oxygenated blood to meet the body's demands during exertion, causing fatigue and dyspnea. While important, it is not the priority in an acute pulmonary edema crisis. In an acute crisis, the patient cannot even tolerate being at rest, let alone being active.\n\n(A) Risk for infection (like pneumonia) is a valid concern due to fluid stasis in the lungs, but it is a potential problem that develops over time, not the immediate life-threatening issue.\n\n(B) Impaired skin integrity is a risk for patients with heart failure due to edema and immobility, but it is not an acute priority.\n\n(D) Constipation is a minor issue compared to the life-threatening respiratory distress of pulmonary edema.",
    "additional": "Rationale for the True Priority (Impaired Gas Exchange): Pulmonary edema is the accumulation of fluid in the alveoli and interstitial spaces of the lungs. This fluid barrier prevents oxygen and carbon dioxide from moving effectively between the alveoli and the capillaries. This leads to severe dyspnea, hypoxemia (low blood oxygen), and is a medical emergency. Therefore, Impaired Gas Exchange is the absolute highest priority nursing diagnosis, as it relates directly to the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation).\n\nSigns of Pulmonary Edema: Classic signs include severe dyspnea, feeling of suffocation, tachypnea, tachycardia, anxiety, confusion, and pink, frothy sputum. On auscultation, you will hear diffuse crackles (rales).\n\nPriority Nursing Interventions for Pulmonary Edema:\n- Positioning: Place the patient in a high-Fowler's position with legs dangling, if possible. This helps reduce venous return to the heart and allows for better lung expansion.\n- Oxygen: Administer high-flow oxygen via a non-rebreather mask to improve oxygenation.\n\nMedications (as ordered):\n- Diuretics (IV Furosemide): To rapidly remove excess fluid.\n- Vasodilators (Nitroglycerin): To reduce preload and afterload.\n- Morphine: To reduce anxiety, preload, and the work of breathing.\n\nMonitoring: Continuously monitor vital signs, oxygen saturation, and lung sounds.\n\nHow NCK Might Test This:\nThey will ask for the priority nursing action, the priority assessment finding to report, or the expected outcome of a medication like furosemide. Always choose the option that addresses the most immediate life-threat (impaired gas exchange).\n\nTextbook Reference:\nBrunner & Suddarth's Textbook of Medical-Surgical Nursing, 14th Ed., Chapter 28: Management of Patients With Structural, Infectious, and Inflammatory Cardiac Disorders.

      "C": "Delay release of calcium from intracellular reservoirs",
      "D": "Reduce peripheral resistance & venous return"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Morphine has two primary hemodynamic effects that are beneficial in acute pulmonary edema:\n\n- Venodilation: It dilates the peripheral veins, which causes blood to pool in the extremities. This reduces venous return to the heart (decreases preload). A lower preload means the struggling left ventricle has less blood to pump, which alleviates congestion in the pulmonary circulation.\n\n- Arterial Vasodilation: It causes mild dilation of arteries, which reduces systemic vascular resistance (decreases afterload). This makes it easier for the heart to pump blood forward.\n\nBy reducing both preload and afterload, morphine decreases the workload on the heart and helps resolve pulmonary congestion.",
    "additional": "Analysis of Incorrect Options:\n\n(A) Morphine does not have a direct diuretic effect. That is the function of diuretics like furosemide.\n\n(B) Morphine relieves dyspnea indirectly, but does not directly relieve hypoxemia. The physiological mechanism is reduced preload/afterload.\n\n(C) Morphine does not affect intracellular calcium in cardiac cells. That role belongs to calcium channel blockers.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n- Morphine also reduces anxiety, which breaks the catecholamine-induced cycle of tachycardia and oxygen demand.\n- Monitor for respiratory depression.

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "(C) Why it's correct: A new systolic murmur appearing acutely after a myocardial infarction (MI) is a classic sign of papillary muscle rupture or dysfunction. The papillary muscles are attached to the mitral valve leaflets. An MI can cut off blood supply to these muscles, causing them to rupture. This leads to acute, severe mitral regurgitation (blood flowing backward from the left ventricle to the left atrium during systole). This regurgitation creates a loud, \"whooshing\" systolic murmur best heard at the cardiac apex (the location of the mitral valve).

    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "(D) Why it's correct: Morphine is a cornerstone in the initial management of acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema for two main reasons:\n\nVenodilation: It dilates the peripheral veins, which causes blood to pool in the periphery. This decreases the amount of blood returning to the already overwhelmed heart (reduces preload).\n\nArterial Dilation: It causes mild arterial dilation, which reduces the resistance the heart has to pump against (reduces afterload).\nBy reducing both preload and afterload, morphine decreases the workload of the heart and helps alleviate the fluid backup into the lungs.",
    "additional": "Preload and Afterload: These are fundamental concepts in cardiology.\n\nPreload: The volume of blood in the ventricles at the end of diastole (just before contraction). It's the stretch on the muscle. Think of it as the \"load\" coming to the heart.\n\nAfterload: The resistance the left ventricle must overcome to circulate blood.

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "(B) Why it's correct: Central Venous Pressure (CVP) is a measurement of the pressure in the vena cava, near the right atrium. It directly reflects the volume of blood returning to the heart and the ability of the right side of the heart to pump that blood. Therefore, CVP is an excellent indicator of the patient's fluid volume status (or preload of the right ventricle).\n\nA low CVP (e.g., <2 mmHg) suggests hypovolemia (dehydration, blood loss).\n\nA high CVP (e.g., >8 mmHg) suggests hypervolemia (fluid overload) or right-sided heart failure.\nIt is crucial for guiding fluid resuscitation in critically ill patients to avoid both under- and over-hydration.",
    "additional": "Normal CVP: 2-8 mmHg.\n\nPhlebostatic Axis: To get an accurate CVP reading, the transducer must be leveled at the phlebostatic axis (4th intercostal space, midaxillary line), which approximates the level of the right atrium.\n\nCVP vs. PA Catheter: Know the difference.

      "d": "Administer oxygen 4 L per minute by nasal cannula"
    },
    "answer": "c",
    "explanation": "Correct (c): The symptoms of fluid overload (also known as hypervolemia) often include respiratory distress (dyspnea, orthopnea, crackles in the lungs) due to pulmonary edema. Elevating the head of the bed (Semi-Fowler's or High-Fowler's position) is the immediate priority. This action uses gravity to decrease venous return to the heart and allows for maximum lung expansion, which immediately eases the work of breathing and improves oxygenation. This is a rapid, non-invasive intervention that directly addresses the most life-threatening symptom.\n\nIncorrect (a, b): Measuring intake and output is a crucial assessment and monitoring tool, but it does not provide immediate relief. It is part of the ongoing management, not the first step to alleviate acute symptoms.\n\nIncorrect (d): Administering oxygen is also a very important intervention for a hypoxic patient, but positioning the patient to improve their own breathing mechanics is the foundational first step. Often, positioning alone can significantly improve oxygen saturation. The ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) guide this: positioning opens the airway and improves the mechanics of breathing.",
    "additional": "Deeper Insight: The signs and symptoms of fluid volume excess include: weight gain, edema (peripheral and pulmonary), distended neck veins (JVD), bounding pulse, hypertension, and shortness of breath with crackles on auscultation. Management includes positioning, oxygen therapy, fluid restriction, and administration of diuretics (like furosemide).\n\nPossible Next Question (NCK Focus): \"A nurse is administering a dose of intravenous furosemide to a client with fluid overload. Which lab value is most important for the nurse to monitor?\" The answer would be serum potassium, as loop diuretics like furosemide cause significant potassium loss."

    "answer": "c",
    "explanation": "Correct (c): The question asks what is NOT a sign of hyperkalemia. Prominent U waves are a classic ECG finding in HYPOkalemia (low potassium), not hyperkalemia.\n\nIncorrect (a, b, d): These are all characteristic ECG changes of HYPERkalemia (high potassium). As potassium levels rise, the typical progression on an ECG is:\n\nTall, peaked T waves (earliest sign).\n\nProlonged PR interval.\n\nFlattened or absent P waves.\n\nWidened QRS complex.\n\nUltimately, the QRS can merge with the T wave to form a sine-wave pattern, which precedes asystole or ventricular fibrillation.",
    "additional": "Deeper Insight: Hyperkalemia is the most life-threatening electrolyte imbalance because it can cause fatal cardiac arrhythmias. It is a common complication of renal failure because the kidneys are responsible for excreting potassium. Management of severe hyperkalemia includes administering IV calcium gluconate (to stabilize the cardiac membrane), insulin and glucose (to drive potassium into the cells), sodium bicarbonate, and Kayexalate or dialysis (to remove potassium from the body).\n\nPossible Next Question (NCK Focus): \"A client's potassium level is 6.8 mEq/L. The nurse anticipates an order for which medication to be administered first to protect the heart?\" The answer is intravenous calcium gluconate."

      "a": "This is normal",
      "b": "The tube may be occluded",
      "c": "The lung has fully expanded",
      "d": "The client needs to cough and deep breath"
    },
    "answer": "a",
    "explanation": "Correct (a): Following cardiac surgery, some bleeding into the mediastinal space is expected. Drainage from a mediastinal chest tube up to 100-150 ml per hour in the first few hours post-op is considered normal. An output of 75 ml in the first hour is well within this expected range.\n\nIncorrect (b): If the tube were occluded, there would be little to no drainage, which would be a cause for concern as it could lead to cardiac tamponade (blood accumulating around the heart and compressing it).\n\nIncorrect (c): A mediastinal tube drains fluid from around the heart, not the pleural space. Therefore, its output is not an indicator of lung expansion. A pleural chest tube would be used for that purpose.\n\nIncorrect (d): While coughing and deep breathing are important post-op interventions to prevent atelectasis, they are not directly related to the interpretation of this specific amount of chest tube drainage.",
    "additional": "Deeper Insight: The nurse must closely monitor mediastinal tube output. A sudden cessation of previously flowing drainage is a red flag for a clot or occlusion. Conversely, drainage that is excessive (e.g., >200 ml/hr for a few consecutive hours) or suddenly becomes bright red and profuse is a red flag for hemorrhage. Both situations are emergencies requiring immediate physician notification.\n\nPossible Next Question (NCK Focus): \"The mediastinal chest tube of a client who is 4 hours post-CABG suddenly stops draining. The client's blood pressure drops to 85/60 mmHg, heart rate is 130 bpm, and neck veins are distended. The nurse suspects which complication?\" The answer would be cardiac tamponade."

      "c": "Giving pain medication",
      "d": "Keep the patient in a calm environment"
    },
    "answer": "a",
    "explanation": "Correct (a): The combination of chest pain, ECG changes, and elevated troponins confirms a myocardial infarction (MI). The immediate goals are to increase myocardial oxygen supply and decrease myocardial oxygen demand. Applying oxygen is a primary step to increase oxygen saturation and supply to the ischemic heart muscle, even if the pulse oximetry reading is >94%, as per many protocols. The standard mnemonic for initial MI care is MONA (Morphine, Oxygen, Nitroglycerin, Aspirin), though the order of application varies. Oxygen is almost always a correct early step.\n\nIncorrect (b): The diagnosis is already strongly suspected, if not confirmed. Waiting for further confirmation delays critical treatment.\n\nIncorrect (c): Giving pain medication (morphine) is also a correct and very high-priority action, as it reduces pain, anxiety, and myocardial oxygen demand. However, ensuring oxygenation (the 'O' in ABC) is often considered the foundational step. In practice, oxygen, aspirin, and nitroglycerin are often given nearly simultaneously.\n\nIncorrect (d): Keeping the patient calm is important but is an outcome of other interventions like providing reassurance and giving morphine. It is not the first, most direct therapeutic action.",
    "additional": "Deeper Insight: The current evidence-based sequence for MI treatment is often cited as:\n\nAspirin: Chewable aspirin (162-325 mg) is given immediately to inhibit platelet aggregation.\n\nNitroglycerin: Sublingual nitroglycerin is given to dilate coronary arteries and reduce preload, unless the patient is hypotensive or has taken a phosphodiesterase inhibitor (like sildenafil).\n\nOxygen: Applied if the patient is hypoxic (SpO2 < 94%).\n\nMorphine: Given for persistent chest pain not relieved by nitroglycerin.\n\nPossible Next Question (NCK Focus): \"A nurse is preparing to administer sublingual nitroglycerin to a client with chest pain. Which assessment finding would cause the nurse to hold the medication and notify the physician?\" The answer would be a blood pressure of 88/50 mmHg."

      "c": "Cardiogenic shock",
      "d": "Hypovolemic shock"
    },
    "answer": "d",
    "explanation": "Correct (d): An aortic aneurysm is a weakened, bulging area in the wall of the aorta. Severe chest or back pain (\"ripping\" or \"tearing\" in nature), anxiety, and diaphoresis are classic signs of an aortic dissection or rupture. A rupture leads to massive internal hemorrhage into the thoracic or abdominal cavity. This catastrophic loss of circulating blood volume results in hypovolemic shock.\n\nIncorrect (a, b): Septic shock is caused by infection, and anaphylactic shock is caused by an allergic reaction. These are not related to an aortic aneurysm rupture.\n\nIncorrect (c): Cardiogenic shock is pump failure (the heart muscle itself fails), often due to a massive MI. While dissection can lead to complications that cause pump failure (like cardiac tamponade or MI if the coronary arteries are involved), the primary and most immediate shock state from a rupture is due to blood loss (hypovolemia).",
    "additional": "Deeper Insight: An aortic dissection/rupture is one of the most lethal medical emergencies. The absolute priority is to control blood pressure and heart rate to reduce the force of ejection and shear stress on the aorta. This is typically done with IV beta-blockers (like esmolol or labetalol). The patient will require immediate surgical repair.\n\nPossible Next Question (NCK Focus): \"What is the priority assessment finding in a client with a suspected thoracic aortic aneurysm?\" The answer would be a difference in blood pressure between the right and left arms."

      "A": "Relax the walls of the heart's arteries.",
      "B": "Improve the strength of the heart beat.",
      "C": "Prevent irregularities in ventricular contractions.",
      "D": "Decrease inflammation of the heart wall."
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Digoxin is a cardiac glycoside, a class of medication with very specific effects on the heart muscle.\n\nPrimary Mechanism (Inotropy): Digoxin's main therapeutic action is its positive inotropic effect. This means it increases the force and velocity of myocardial contraction. It achieves this by inhibiting the Na+/K+-ATPase pump in cardiac cells, which leads to an increase in intracellular calcium. More calcium available to the contractile proteins results in a stronger heartbeat. This is particularly useful in heart failure, where the heart's pumping ability is weakened.\n\nOther Effects (Chronotropy/Dromotropy): Digoxin also has a negative chronotropic (decreases heart rate) and negative dromotropic (slows conduction through the AV node) effect. This is why it's also used to control the ventricular rate in tachyarrhythmias like atrial fibrillation. However, its primary purpose, especially in heart failure, is to improve contractility.",
    "additional": "Analyzing the Options:\n\n(a) Relaxing arteries is the function of vasodilators (like nitrates or ACE inhibitors).\n\n(c) While it helps control the rate of ventricular contractions in atrial fibrillation, its main role isn't preventing the irregularities themselves. Antiarrhythmics like amiodarone are used for that.\n\n(d) Decreasing inflammation is the function of anti-inflammatory drugs (like NSAIDs or steroids).\n\nDigoxin Toxicity: This is a major and frequently tested concept. Digoxin has a very narrow therapeutic range (typically 0.5-2.0 ng/mL).\n\nSigns & Symptoms: Early signs include GI distress (anorexia, nausea, vomiting). Later signs include neurological issues (fatigue, confusion) and classic visual disturbances (blurred vision, yellow-green halos around lights).\n\nCardiac Signs: Toxicity can cause a wide range of arrhythmias, but the most classic sign is bradycardia.\n\nNursing Implications:\n\nApical Pulse: The nurse must check the patient's apical pulse for a full minute before administering digoxin. The medication is typically held if the heart rate is <60 bpm in an adult.\n\nElectrolytes: Hypokalemia (low potassium) is the most common cause of digoxin toxicity because potassium and digoxin compete for the same binding sites on the Na+/K+-ATPase pump. When potassium is low, more digoxin can bind, increasing its effect. Nurses must monitor potassium levels closely. Hypercalcemia and hypomagnesemia also increase the risk.\n\nAntidote: The antidote for severe digoxin toxicity is Digoxin Immune Fab (Digibind).\n\nTextbook Reference: Lewis's Medical-Surgical Nursing: Assessment and Management of Clinical Problems, Chapter 34: Heart Failure."

    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Pulmonary edema is a life-threatening complication of acute decompensated heart failure. The left ventricle is too weak to pump blood forward, causing it to back up into the lungs. This leads to severe dyspnea and hypoxia.\n\nEvaluating the Options:\n\n(a) Risk for infection is a valid concern, as fluid-filled lungs are a breeding ground for bacteria, but it is not the immediate priority over the hemodynamic and oxygenation problems.\n\n(b) Impaired skin integrity is a risk due to edema and immobility, but it is a long-term problem, not the acute priority.\n\n(c) Activity intolerance directly addresses the core problem: the heart (the pump) is failing to meet the body's metabolic demands. This pump failure is the root cause of all the other symptoms, including the pulmonary edema. The extreme fatigue and dyspnea on exertion are manifestations of this profound intolerance.\n\n(d) Constipation is a potential secondary problem but is the lowest priority.",
    "additional": "Prioritization: In nursing, we use Maslow's hierarchy or the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation). The patient with pulmonary edema has a critical problem with Breathing and Circulation. Activity intolerance is a direct reflection of the failing circulation (pump failure). Therefore, it is the most relevant and high-priority diagnosis among the choices provided.\n\nHallmark Signs of Pulmonary Edema:\n- Severe dyspnea, tachypnea, and orthopnea (inability to breathe while lying flat).\n- Pink, frothy sputum (classic sign).\n- Crackles (rales) heard on lung auscultation.\n- Anxiety, restlessness, feeling of impending doom.\n\nPriority Nursing Interventions for Pulmonary Edema:\n\nPositioning: Place the patient in a high-Fowler's position with legs dependent (dangling). This helps to decrease venous return to the heart (preload) and allows for maximal lung expansion.\n\nOxygen: Administer high-flow oxygen via a non-rebreather mask.\n\nMedications (L-M-N-O-P):\n- Lasix (Furosemide): A potent loop diuretic to rapidly pull fluid off the lungs.\n- Morphine: A vasodilator that reduces preload and afterload, and also decreases anxiety and the work of breathing.\n- Nitrates (Nitroglycerin): A potent vasodilator to reduce preload.\n- Oxygen.\n- Positioning.\n\nMonitoring: Continuous monitoring of vital signs, oxygen saturation, and urine output (to assess diuretic effectiveness) is crucial.\n\nTextbook Reference: Brunner & Suddarth's Textbook of Medical-Surgical Nursing, Chapter 29: Management of Patients with Heart Failure."

The underlying pathology is atherosclerosis, which is accelerated by hyperglycemia.\n\nReducing Atherosclerosis Risk: The goal is to manage all known risk factors for atherosclerosis.\n\nWeight reduction: Decreases the overall metabolic burden, improves insulin sensitivity, and helps lower blood pressure.\n\nReducing fat/triglyceride levels: Directly targets dyslipidemia, a key component of plaque formation. This involves dietary changes and often statin medication.\n\nQuitting smoking: Smoking is a major independent risk factor for atherosclerosis. It damages the endothelial lining of blood vessels, promotes vasoconstriction, and increases platelet aggregation.",

    "explanation": "Hyperkalemia is a high serum potassium level (>5.0 mEq/L). It occurs from either increased potassium intake, decreased potassium excretion, or a shift of potassium from inside the cells to the bloodstream.\n\nRenal Failure: The kidneys are the primary route for potassium excretion. In renal failure, the kidneys cannot adequately filter potassium from the blood, leading to its accumulation. This is the most common cause of chronic hyperkalemia.\n\nCrush Injuries & Burns: These conditions cause massive cell destruction (rhabdomyolysis). Potassium is primarily an intracellular ion.

The goal is to reduce intake of lipids that contribute to plaque formation.\n\n(a) 30% of daily calorie intake with 10% saturated fats: This aligns with general heart-healthy dietary guidelines. Major health organizations recommend that total fat intake should be around 25–35% of total calories, and crucially, saturated fat should be limited to less than 10% (and ideally <7%) of total calories. This option fits these criteria best.\n\n(b) ...400mg Of daily cholesterol intake: This is too high. The recommendation for individuals at risk for heart disease is to limit dietary cholesterol to less than 200 mg per day.\n\n(c) 50% of daily calorie intake...: A diet with 50% of calories from fat is a high-fat diet and would be contraindicated for a patient with atherosclerosis.\n\n(d) 10% of daily calorie intake...: A diet with only 10% of calories from fat is extremely low-fat and may be difficult to adhere to and nutritionally inadequate in fat-soluble vitamins. While monounsaturated fats are healthy, the total fat percentage is too low for a general recommendation.",

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This question asks for the most common preventable cause of valvular heart disease, which points towards a condition that can be treated before it damages the heart valves.\n\n(d) Beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection: This is the correct answer. An untreated or inadequately treated infection with Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (the cause of \"strep throat\" and scarlet fever) can lead to Rheumatic Fever. Rheumatic fever is an inflammatory disease that can cause permanent damage to the heart valves, a condition known as Rheumatic Heart Disease. The mitral valve is most commonly affected. This is preventable by promptly treating streptococcal infections with antibiotics (e.g., penicillin).\n\n(a) Congenital disease...: Congenital valve defects (e.g., bicuspid aortic valve) are a common cause of valvular disease, but they are not considered preventable as they form during fetal development.\n\n(b) Calcium deposits and thrombus formation: This describes the process of degenerative valve disease (e.g., aortic stenosis), which is common in the elderly. While managing risk factors like hypertension and hyperlipidemia can help, the degenerative aging process itself is not fully preventable.\n\n(c) Marfan's syndrome: This is a genetic connective tissue disorder that can lead to valvular problems (especially mitral valve prolapse and aortic root dilation), but it is a genetic condition and therefore not preventable.",
    "additional": "Pathophysiology of Rheumatic Heart Disease: The antibodies the body creates to fight the streptococcal bacteria cross-react with proteins in the heart tissue (a process called molecular mimicry), leading to pancarditis (inflammation of all layers of the heart). The inflammation causes scarring and fibrosis of the valve leaflets, leading to stenosis (narrowing) or regurgitation (leaking).\n\nKey Signs of Valvular Disease: The most common symptom is dyspnea on exertion. A heart murmur, an abnormal sound heard on auscultation, is the primary sign.\n\nPrevention: The key to prevention is the early diagnosis and complete course of antibiotic treatment for all streptococcal pharyngitis cases.\n\nPotential Future Questions: \"Which heart valve is most commonly affected by Rheumatic Heart Disease?\" (Mitral valve).

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This question tests understanding of fluid dynamics at the capillary level, specifically the forces that pull fluid into the vascular space.\n\n(a) Albumin, globulin: This is the correct answer. Colloid osmotic pressure (also called oncotic pressure) is the \"pulling\" pressure exerted by large molecules (colloids), primarily proteins, that cannot easily pass through the capillary wall. These proteins draw water towards them, holding fluid within the capillaries. Albumin is the most abundant plasma protein and is therefore the main contributor to colloid osmotic pressure. Globulins are another group of plasma proteins that also contribute.\n\n(b), (c), (d): These options are incorrect because they include electrolytes (potassium, sodium). Electrolytes are small solutes that pass freely across the capillary membrane and therefore do not exert a significant osmotic \"pull.\" They contribute to the overall osmolarity of the plasma but not specifically to the colloid osmotic pressure that counteracts the hydrostatic (pushing) pressure.",
    "additional": "Starling's Forces: Capillary fluid exchange is governed by four forces:\n\nCapillary Hydrostatic Pressure (Pushing out): The pressure of blood against the capillary walls.\n\nInterstitial Hydrostatic Pressure (Pushing in): The pressure of fluid in the interstitial space.\n\nCapillary Colloid Osmotic Pressure (Pulling in): The \"pull\" from plasma proteins (like albumin).\n\nInterstitial Colloid Osmotic Pressure (Pulling out): The \"pull\" from any proteins in the interstitial fluid.\n\nClinical Significance (Low Albumin): In conditions where albumin levels are low (hypoalbuminemia), such as liver failure (liver produces albumin) or nephrotic syndrome (large amounts of albumin lost in urine), the capillary colloid osmotic pressure decreases. This weakens the \"pulling\" force holding fluid in the vessels, allowing more fluid to leak into the interstitial space, resulting in edema.\n\nPotential Future Questions: \"A patient with severe liver cirrhosis presents with ascites and peripheral edema.

    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This question requires an understanding of how heart rate affects key hemodynamic parameters. Sinus bradycardia is a heart rate below 60 bpm.\n\n(viii) Decreased mean arterial pressure, increased preload: This is the correct answer.\n\nDecreased Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP): Cardiac Output (CO) = Heart Rate (HR) x Stroke Volume (SV). Since HR is low in bradycardia, the CO will decrease (assuming SV doesn't compensate enough). MAP is directly related to CO (MAP ≈ CO x SVR). Therefore, a drop in CO will lead to a decreased MAP, which can cause symptoms like dizziness or syncope.\n\nIncreased Preload: The slower heart rate allows more time for the ventricles to fill with blood during diastole. This increased ventricular filling time leads to a greater end-diastolic volume, which is the definition of increased preload.\n\n(vi): \"Decreased filling times\" is incorrect; bradycardia increases filling time.\n\n(vii): Bradycardia itself does not increase myocardial oxygen demand; tachycardia does.\n\n(ix): \"Increased mean arterial pressure\" is incorrect; a low heart rate tends to decrease MAP.",
    "additional": "Causes of Sinus Bradycardia: Can be normal in well-conditioned athletes. Pathological causes include vagal stimulation (e.g., vomiting, suctioning), hypothyroidism, increased ICP, and medications (e.g., beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers).\n\nWhen to Treat: Bradycardia is only treated if the patient is symptomatic (e.g., hypotension, dizziness, syncope, shortness of breath, altered mental status).\n\nTreatment of Symptomatic Bradycardia:\n\nAtropine: First-line drug. It is an anticholinergic that blocks vagal influence, thereby increasing the heart rate.\n\nTranscutaneous Pacing (TCP): If atropine is ineffective.\n\nDopamine or Epinephrine Infusion: Can be used while awaiting a pacemaker.\n\nPermanent Pacemaker: For long-term management of chronic symptomatic bradycardia.\n\nPotential Future Questions: \"What is the first-line medication for the treatment of symptomatic sinus bradycardia?\" (Atropine).

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "(a) Slow loss of sight, loss of visual field, cupping of the optic disc: This is the classic triad for Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma (POAG). It is often called the \"silent thief of sight\" because its onset is slow, insidious, and painless. The first sign is often a gradual loss of peripheral vision (tunnel vision). Ophthalmic examination reveals an increased cup-to-disc ratio (cupping) due to optic nerve damage from the chronically elevated intraocular pressure (IOP).\n\n(b) & (c): \"Rapid loss of vision,\" \"severe eye pain,\" \"corneal oedema,\" and \"dilated pupil\" are the hallmark signs of Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma (AACG).

    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Following a myocardial infarction (MI), the heart muscle is irritable and prone to dangerous arrhythmias. Multifocal PVCs indicate that multiple areas in the ventricles are firing ectopically, which can quickly deteriorate into life-threatening rhythms like ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. This finding requires immediate intervention.\n\nOption A: A urinary output of 120 mL in 2 hours is 60 mL/hour, which is within the normal range for an adult (generally >30 mL/hour or 0.5-1.0 mL/kg/hr).[9][10][11]\n\nOption C: Clear breath sounds are a normal and desirable finding, indicating the absence of fluid buildup in the lungs (pulmonary edema), a common complication of MI.\n\nOption D: Elevated cardiac enzymes (like troponin) and an elevated white blood cell count (due to inflammation of the heart muscle) are expected findings after an MI.",
    "additional": "NCK Focus: Prioritizing care for the post-MI patient is a common topic. Life-threatening arrhythmias and signs of cardiogenic shock (e.g., hypotension, altered mental status, poor perfusion) are always the highest priority.\n\nMI Complications: Key complications include dysrhythmias, heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and papillary muscle rupture. The nurse must continuously assess for signs of these issues.[12]\n\nPVCs: While isolated, unifocal PVCs can be common, multifocal PVCs, couplets (two in a row), or runs of PVCs (ventricular tachycardia) are a sign of significant cardiac irritability and require immediate treatment."

    "question": "The client asks the nurse, \"My doctor just told me that atherosclerosis is why my chest hurts when I walk real fast. What does that mean?\" Which statement is the nurse's best response?",
    "options": {
      "A": "The muscle fibers and endothelial lining of your arteries have become thickened.",
      "B": "You sound concerned because your chest hurts when you walk real fast.",
      "C": "The valves in your heart are incompetent, which is why your chest hurts with activity.",
      "D": "You have a hardening of your arteries with fatty buildup that decreases the oxygen to your heart."
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This response provides a simple, clear, and accurate explanation of atherosclerosis in lay terms. It correctly identifies the two key components: hardening of the arteries and fatty buildup (plaque), and links it directly to the client's symptom by explaining that it reduces oxygen flow to the heart, causing pain (angina) during exertion.[2]\n\nOption A: This uses medical terminology (\"endothelial lining\") that the client may not understand.\n\nOption B: This is a therapeutic communication technique that reflects the client's feelings but does not answer their direct question for information.\n\nOption C: This describes valvular heart disease, not atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis affects the arteries, not the valves.",
    "additional": "NCK Focus: Therapeutic communication is essential, but so is providing clear, accurate patient education. Questions may require you to choose the best response that accomplishes both, or to prioritize providing factual information when it is directly requested.\n\nPathophysiology of Atherosclerosis: It is a process of repeated injury to the artery walls, leading to the buildup of fatty deposits, cholesterol, and other substances into plaques. These plaques can narrow or block arteries, restricting blood flow.[2]"

    "question": "The client diagnosed with peripheral vascular disease is overweight, has smoked two packs of cigarettes a day for 20 years, and sits behind a desk all day. Which statement by the client refers to the strongest factor in the development of atherosclerotic lesions?",
    "options": {
      "A": "I am going to try and lose at least 20 pounds.",
      "B": "I have to get out from behind the desk more often.”",
      "C": "I am going to eat foods that are high in fiber.”",
      "D": "I have to quit smoking cigarettes but it will be hard."
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "While all the options are positive lifestyle changes, smoking is the single most important and powerful modifiable risk factor for the development and progression of atherosclerosis.[2][33] The chemicals in tobacco directly damage the arterial lining, promote plaque formation, reduce the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, and cause vasoconstriction.[33] Recognizing the need to quit smoking addresses the most significant contributing factor.\n\nOptions A (Obesity), B (Sedentary Lifestyle), and C (Diet): These are all significant modifiable risk factors, but smoking has the most potent and direct damaging effect on the vascular system.[34]",
    "additional": "NCK Focus: Be prepared to rank the importance of various risk factors. For cardiovascular disease, smoking cessation is almost always the highest priority lifestyle modification.[35]\n\nBenefits of Quitting: The benefits of quitting smoking begin almost immediately. The risk of heart attack drops sharply within 1–2 years of quitting.[36][37][38]"

    "question": "The female client tells the nurse that her cholesterol level was 189 mg/dL. Which action should the nurse implement?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Praise the client for having an acceptable cholesterol level.",
      "B": "Explain that the client needs to lower the cholesterol level.",
      "C": "Discuss dietary changes that could help increase the level.",
      "D": "Allow the client to ventilate feelings about the blood result."
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "A total cholesterol level below 200 mg/dL is considered desirable and is a target for preventing cardiovascular disease. A level of 189 mg/dL is within this healthy range. Therefore, the appropriate nursing action is to provide positive reinforcement and praise the client for this good result, which encourages continued healthy behaviors.\n\nOptions B and C: These are incorrect as the level is already within the desirable range and does not need to be lowered or increased.\n\nOption D: While therapeutic, there is no indication that the client has negative feelings about this excellent result that would require ventilation. The most direct and appropriate action is positive reinforcement.",
    "additional": "NCK Focus: Knowledge of normal laboratory values is essential. For cholesterol, this includes:\nTotal Cholesterol: <200 mg/dL (Desirable)\nLDL (\"Bad\") Cholesterol: <100 mg/dL (Optimal)\nHDL (\"Good\") Cholesterol: >60 mg/dL (Protective)\n\nHealth Promotion: An important nursing role is health promotion and positive reinforcement.

    "question": "The nurse is discussing the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis with a client who has a high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) level. Which information should the nurse discuss with the clients concerning the pathophysiology of LDL?",
    "options": {
      "A": "A high LDL is good because it has a protective action in the body.",
      "B": "This test result measures the free fatty acids and glycerol in the blood.",
      "C": "LDLs are the primary transporters of cholesterol into the cell.",
      "D": "The client needs to decrease the amount of cholesterol and fat in the diet."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) are the primary carriers of cholesterol in the bloodstream. Their function is to transport cholesterol from the liver to various cells throughout the body. When LDL levels are high, they deposit excess cholesterol into the walls of arteries, leading to the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. This is why LDL is often called \"bad cholesterol.\"\n\nOption A: This describes High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL), or \"good cholesterol,\" which transports cholesterol away from the arteries and back to the liver for excretion.\n\nOption B: This describes triglycerides, which are another type of lipid in the blood.\n\nOption D: While this is correct dietary advice for the client, it does not answer the question about the pathophysiology (the function) of LDL.",
    "additional": "NCK Focus: You must know the lipid panel components and their roles in health and disease.\n\nLDL (Low-Density Lipoprotein): \"Lousy\" or \"bad\" cholesterol. Carries cholesterol to the arteries. High levels lead to atherosclerosis. Goal is < 100 mg/dL.\nHDL (High-Density Lipoprotein): \"Healthy\" or \"good\" cholesterol. Removes cholesterol from arteries. High levels are protective. Goal is > 40-60 mg/dL.\nTriglycerides: A type of fat in the blood. High levels contribute to heart disease. Goal is < 150 mg/dL.\nPatient Education: Teaching should focus on lifestyle modifications to improve the lipid profile: low-fat/low-cholesterol diet, regular exercise, smoking cessation, and weight management."

    "question": "Which assessment data would cause the nurse to suspect the client has atherosclerosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "The client complains of her legs swelling when she stands for long periods.",
      "B": "The client has episodes of jitteriness and headache when feeling hungry.",
      "C": "The client has bilateral calf pain when walking for short periods.",
      "D": "The client complains of mid-epigastric pain after eating spicy foods."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Bilateral calf pain that occurs with exertion (like walking) and is relieved by rest is the classic sign of intermittent claudication. This is a hallmark symptom of peripheral arterial disease (PAD), which is caused by atherosclerotic plaques narrowing the arteries in the legs. The pain is due to muscle ischemia (lack of oxygen) during activity.\n\nOption A: Leg swelling (edema) that worsens with standing is characteristic of venous insufficiency, not arterial disease.\n\nOption B: Jitteriness and headache with hunger are classic symptoms of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar).\n\nOption D: Mid-epigastric pain after eating spicy foods suggests a gastrointestinal issue, such as gastritis or peptic ulcer disease.",
    "additional": "NCK Focus: Differentiating between arterial and venous disease of the extremities is a key nursing skill.\n\nArterial (PAD): Intermittent claudication, pale or cool skin, weak or absent pulses, hair loss on legs, painful ulcers on toes/feet.\nVenous: Edema, varicose veins, brownish skin discoloration, ulcers on ankles.\nThe 6 P's of Acute Arterial Occlusion: A critical assessment to know is for acute limb ischemia: Pain, Pallor (paleness), Pulselessness, Paresthesia (numbness/tingling), Paralysis, and Poikilothermia (coolness).

      "B": "Instruct the client to take the medication in the evening.",
      "C": "Explain that muscle pain is a common side effect of this medication.",
      "D": "Demonstrate how to use the machine to check the cholesterol level daily."
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The body's natural synthesis of cholesterol is highest during the night. Therefore, statin medications like atorvastatin are most effective when taken in the evening or at bedtime to maximally inhibit this process.\n\nOption A: Statins can be taken with or without food.\n\nOption C: Muscle pain (myopathy) is not a common side effect; it is a serious adverse effect that could indicate rhabdomyolysis, a condition involving muscle breakdown that can lead to kidney failure. The client should be taught to report any unexplained muscle pain or weakness to their HCP immediately.\n\nOption D: Cholesterol levels are monitored with periodic lab tests (e.g., every 4-12 weeks initially, then every 3-12 months), not checked daily at home.",
    "additional": "NCK Focus: Statin medications are a major drug class. Key knowledge points include:\n\nMechanism: Inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis.\nPrimary Side Effects: Generally well-tolerated.\nAdverse Effects: Hepatotoxicity (liver damage) and myopathy/rhabdomyolysis.\nNursing Interventions: Monitor liver function tests (AST/ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) levels if myopathy is suspected.

      "B": "Ham and cheese on white bread and whole milk.",
      "C": "Baked fish, brown rice, lettuce salad, and iced tea.",
      "D": "A hamburger, potato chips, and carbonated beverage."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This meal is the healthiest choice for a heart-healthy diet. Baked fish is low in saturated fat and a good source of omega-3 fatty acids. Brown rice is a whole grain, providing complex carbohydrates and fiber. A lettuce salad adds vitamins and more fiber. This meal avoids high-fat cooking methods (frying) and processed meats.\n\nOption A: Fried chicken is high in fat and cholesterol.\nOption B: Ham and cheese are processed meats high in sodium and fat. Whole milk is high in fat. White bread is a refined carbohydrate with little fiber.\nOption D: Hamburgers and potato chips are typically high in saturated fat, sodium, and calories.",
    "additional": "NCK Focus: Therapeutic diets are frequently tested. Be familiar with the components of a heart-healthy diet, often referred to as the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet.\n\nKey Principles of a Heart-Healthy Diet:\nLimit: Saturated and trans fats, cholesterol, sodium, red meat, sweets, and sugar-sweetened beverages.\nEmphasize: Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein (fish, poultry), and low-fat dairy.\nCooking Methods: Choose baking, broiling, grilling, or steaming over frying."

      "E": "Discuss the importance of isometric exercises daily."
    },
    "answer": "A, B, C, D",
    "explanation": "Effective patient education is comprehensive and uses multiple strategies to promote adherence.\n\nIncluding a significant other provides a support system and ensures a second person hears the information, which improves adherence.\n\nWritten handouts reinforce verbal teaching and provide a reference for the client at home.\n\nReferrals to organizations like the AHA provide credible resources, support groups, and additional information.\n\nHelping with stress management addresses a key modifiable risk factor.\n\nIsometric exercises (contracting muscles without movement, like pushing against a wall) can significantly raise blood pressure and should be avoided in clients with cardiovascular disease. Isotonic exercises (involving movement, like walking or swimming) are recommended.",
    "additional": "NCK Focus: Be prepared to identify appropriate vs. inappropriate exercises for cardiac patients.\n\nRecommended (Isotonic): Walking, jogging, swimming, biking. These improve cardiovascular fitness.\nAvoid (Isometric): Heavy weightlifting, pushing/pulling heavy objects. These cause a sudden spike in blood pressure.\nPrinciples of Adult Learning: Adults learn best when the information is relevant, practical, and reinforced through multiple methods (verbal, written, demonstration)."

      "D": "Assist the client who just returned from a cardiac catheterization to ambulate."
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Transporting a stable, discharged client is a standard task that falls within the scope of practice for a UAP.\n\nOption A: Teaching is a function of the registered nurse and cannot be delegated.\n\nOption C: Assessing or evaluating lab results is a nursing responsibility.\n\nOption D: A client just back from a cardiac catheterization is considered unstable and requires frequent assessment by the nurse. They are typically on strict bedrest for several hours, and assisting them to ambulate would be unsafe and inappropriate to delegate.",
    "additional": "NCK Focus: Delegation is a critical concept. Remember the Five Rights of Delegation: Right Task, Right Circumstance, Right Person, Right Direction/Communication, and Right Supervision/Evaluation.\n\nWhat CAN be delegated to a UAP: Activities of daily living (ADLs), routine vital signs on stable clients, recording intake and output, and ambulating stable clients.\nWhat CANNOT be delegated: Any part of the nursing process (Assessment, Diagnosis, Planning, Implementation of complex tasks, Evaluation), patient teaching, or care of unstable patients."

    "options": {
      "A": "Splint the incision when turning, coughing, and deep breathing.",
      "B": "Sleep in a recliner or with the head on two pillows at night.",
      "C": "Avoid being around children or people who have had an immunization.",
      "D": "Take antibiotics prior to any dental or other invasive procedures."
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Clients with mechanical heart valves are at a high lifelong risk for developing bacterial endocarditis, an infection of the heart's inner lining or valves. Bacteria can be introduced into the bloodstream during procedures like dental work. Therefore, prophylactic antibiotics are required before such procedures to prevent infection.\n\nOption A: Splinting the incision is important general postoperative teaching for any chest surgery but is not specific to the long-term management of a mechanical valve.\n\nOption B: This might be advised for heart failure symptoms, but it is not a standard instruction for all valve replacement clients.\n\nOption C: This is incorrect and unnecessary.",
    "additional": "NCK Focus: Discharge teaching for a client with a mechanical valve has two crucial, lifelong components:\n\nLifelong Anticoagulation: The client will be on a medication like warfarin (Coumadin) for the rest of their life to prevent blood clots from forming on the artificial valve. This requires regular INR monitoring.\nEndocarditis Prophylaxis: The need for antibiotics before dental and other invasive procedures."

      "A": "Do nothing because the nurse was probably mistaken.",
      "B": "Document the finding in the client's chart.",
      "C": "Notify the HCP.",
      "D": "Ask the client if there is a history of a murmur."
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The best next step follows the nursing process: Assessment. Before reporting a new finding, the nurse should gather more data. Asking the client about a previous history of a murmur is a quick and easy way to clarify if this is a new or known issue. After this, the nurse should perform a more focused assessment (e.g., listen in different positions) and then notify the HCP of the new or newly discovered finding.\n\nOption A: Ignoring a potential abnormal finding is negligent.\n\nOption B: Documenting is important, but notifying the HCP is also necessary if the finding is new and significant. Further assessment should come first.\n\nOption C: Notifying the HCP is appropriate, but it's better to have more information first by asking the client.",
    "additional": "NCK Focus: This question tests clinical judgment and the application of the nursing process (Assess, Diagnose, Plan, Implement, Evaluate). Always perform further assessment of an abnormal finding before jumping to intervention or reporting, if possible and safe to do so."

      "C": "The client has elevated troponin levels.",
      "D": "The client recently took a vacation to Central America."
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Rheumatic fever, which is a complication of an untreated group A streptococcal infection (strep throat), is a primary cause of valvular heart disease, particularly affecting the mitral and aortic valves. A history of rheumatic fever is a major risk factor for developing a heart murmur later in life.\n\nOption B: Taking an anticoagulant suggests the client may have atrial fibrillation or a mechanical valve, but it's not a direct cause of a murmur itself.\n\nOption C: Elevated troponin levels indicate myocardial infarction (heart attack), not chronic valve disease.\n\nOption D: Recent travel is generally irrelevant unless associated with specific infectious diseases not typically linked to valvular problems.",
    "additional": "NCK Focus: Knowing the common causes and risk factors for various cardiovascular disorders is essential.\n\nCauses of Murmurs: Can be caused by valve stenosis (narrowing), valve regurgitation/insufficiency (leaking), or congenital defects.

      "B": "I get short of breath walking to the bathroom to bathe myself.",
      "C": "I made out an advance directive to make sure my wishes are known.",
      "D": "I will be in the intensive care unit for a day or two after surgery."
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The statement \"I get short of breath walking to the bathroom\" indicates that the client has significant dyspnea on minimal exertion. This is a sign of worsening heart failure. It represents an acute change in the client's baseline condition that must be investigated and reported to the surgeon and HCP immediately. The client's hemodynamic status may be too unstable for the planned surgery.\n\nOption A: It's likely the client will be on medications (e.g., for heart failure or anticoagulants) for life, so this is an expected understanding.\n\nOption C: Having an advance directive is appropriate pre-surgical planning.\n\nOption D: An ICU stay is standard after open-heart surgery.",
    "additional": "NCK Focus: Identifying signs of acute clinical deterioration is a priority safety skill. For cardiac patients, a sudden increase in dyspnea, chest pain, or edema indicates decompensation and requires immediate nursing action. The nurse must act as a patient advocate and ensure the surgical team is aware of any acute changes before a procedure."

      "B": "Have routine International Normalized Ratio (INR) lab tests performed.",
      "C": "Limit lifting to less than 5 pounds until you are seen by the surgeon.",
      "D": "Your menses will be heavier because of the anticoagulant medications."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "A lifting restriction is a standard and critical postoperative instruction following any surgery involving the trunk, such as open-heart surgery. This prevents excess strain on the sternal and chest wall incision, promoting proper healing and preventing complications like dehiscence.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect for this specific client: The answer key states that female clients of childbearing age are often given living-tissue valves (bioprosthetic valves) specifically to avoid the need for lifelong anticoagulation, which would be teratogenic during a potential pregnancy.\n\nOption B and D: These relate to anticoagulation therapy (like warfarin), which is required for mechanical valves, not typically for tissue valves. Therefore, routine INR testing and heavier menses would not be expected.\n\nOption A: Taking a temperature is important to monitor for infection, but four times a day is excessive for routine discharge instructions unless a specific concern exists. The client would be taught to monitor for signs of infection, including fever, and report them.",
    "additional": "NCK Focus: You must be able to differentiate the nursing care and patient teaching for the two main types of prosthetic heart valves.\n\nMechanical Valves: Durable, last a lifetime. Require lifelong anticoagulation (warfarin) and regular INR monitoring. High risk of thromboembolism.\nBioprosthetic (Tissue) Valves (e.g., porcine, bovine): Less durable (last 10-20 years). Do not require lifelong anticoagulation. Higher risk of valve degeneration over time.\n\nPatient Teaching: For any open-heart surgery, teach sternal precautions (no lifting, pushing, or pulling), incision care, and signs of infection."

    "explanation": "Clients with cardiac disease need a heart-healthy diet that is low in sodium, saturated fat, and cholesterol. The meal in option B is the best choice. Roast beef is a leaner meat option, a salad provides vegetables, and low-fat dressing keeps the fat content down.\n\nOption A: Ham and cheese are processed meats high in sodium and fat. Potato chips are high in sodium and fat.\n\nOption C: Bacon and eggs are high in saturated fat and cholesterol. While caffeine in moderation may be okay, it can increase heart rate.\n\nOption D: Chicken-fried steak, mashed potatoes, and gravy are all very high in saturated fat, calories, and sodium.",

The nurse's best response is to provide a simple, accurate description of the procedure. An echocardiogram is a non-invasive test that uses ultrasound waves to create images of the heart.\n\nOption A: This is a therapeutic response that dismisses the client's request for information. While addressing fear is important, you must first answer the question asked.\n\nOption B: This describes a cardiac catheterization, which is an invasive procedure, not an echocardiogram.\n\nOption C: This deflects the question and passes responsibility to the doctor. The nurse is qualified to provide a basic explanation of this common, non-invasive test.",
    "additional": "NCK Focus: Patient teaching for diagnostic procedures.

    "explanation": "The client is experiencing acute symptoms of cardiac distress (chest pain and dyspnea) caused by exertion. The first and most immediate priority is to decrease the workload on the heart. Having the client stop the activity and sit down in a wheelchair immediately reduces myocardial oxygen demand and can help relieve the symptoms. Safety and physiological stability come first.\n\nOptions A, B, and D: These are all appropriate subsequent actions. After the client is safely seated and resting, the nurse should assess vital signs, ask about the history of this pain, and obtain an ECG. But the initial action is to stop the precipitating activity.",
    "additional": "NCK Focus: Prioritization questions often test your ability to recognize an unstable situation and intervene to promote safety and physiological integrity first.

      "D": "Palpitations, fatigue, and pink frothy sputum."
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "A grade II murmur is, by definition, quiet but can be heard immediately by an experienced listener with a stethoscope. Early-stage valve disease is often asymptomatic or has very mild symptoms. The most reliable finding is the murmur itself. The auscultation point for the aortic area is the second intercostal space at the right sternal border (or \"right sternal notch\" area).\n\nOptions A, C, and D: These describe symptoms of moderate to severe heart failure (peripheral edema, JVD, dyspnea on exertion, pink frothy sputum which indicates acute pulmonary edema). These would not be expected with a mild, grade II murmur.",

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The telemetry strip shows multifocal premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). This is evident from the wide, misshapen QRS complexes that lack P waves and originate from different locations in the ventricles (multifocal). Lidocaine is a Class IB antiarrhythmic that works by suppressing ventricular ectopy. It is the drug of choice among the options for treating frequent or symptomatic PVCs.\n\nOption A (Adenosine): Used for terminating supraventricular tachycardia (SVT).\nOption C (Digoxin): Used to slow the heart rate in atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter and for heart failure.\nOption D (Dopamine): An inotrope used to increase blood pressure and cardiac output in cases of shock.",
    "additional": "NCK Focus: EKG interpretation and the corresponding pharmacological intervention is a high-level nursing skill that is frequently tested. You must be able to identify a rhythm and know the first-line drug for it.\n\nPVCs: Can be a sign of cardiac irritability due to hypoxia, electrolyte imbalance (especially low potassium or magnesium), or ischemia. Treatment is warranted if they are frequent (>6/min), multifocal, occur in runs (V-tach), or the patient is symptomatic."

    },
    "answer": ["B", "E", "D", "C", "A"],
    "explanation": "The strip shows asystole (a flat line). The priority actions according to ACLS are:\n\nDetermine if the strip is an artifact (B): This is the ABSOLUTE FIRST STEP. Check that the leads are connected and check the patient. Is the patient unresponsive and pulseless? You do not start a code on a conscious person whose leads have fallen off.\n\nStart CPR (E and D): If the patient is unresponsive and pulseless, immediately begin high-quality CPR, starting with chest compressions (CAB: Compressions, Airway, Breathing). The answer key lists breaths first (E) then compressions (D), reflecting older BLS standards. Current standards emphasize starting with compressions.\n\nAdminister Epinephrine (C): Once IV/IO access is established, epinephrine is the primary drug given in asystole/PEA to attempt to restart the heart.\n\nAdminister Atropine (A): (NOTE: This is outdated). The answer key includes atropine. However, current ACLS guidelines (since 2010) do not recommend atropine for asystole or PEA as it has been shown to be ineffective.

    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The most important first step when you see any arrhythmia on a monitor is to assess the patient. Many people, especially athletes, have a normal resting sinus bradycardia and are completely asymptomatic. Treatment is only indicated if the slow heart rate is causing symptoms of poor perfusion, such as hypotension, dizziness, confusion, shortness of breath, or chest pain.\n\nOptions A, C, and D: These are interventions that would only be considered after assessing the patient and determining that they are unstable and require treatment. You never treat the monitor; you treat the patient.",
    "additional": "NCK Focus: This is a classic \"assess the patient first\" question. When given a clinical finding (like a lab value or EKG strip), your first thought should always be, \"How is my patient?\"\n\nSymptomatic Bradycardia Treatment: If the client is unstable, the first-line drug is atropine. If atropine is ineffective, transcutaneous pacing or a dopamine/epinephrine infusion may be used."

      "D": "Request the UAP to take the crash cart to the client's room."
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The telemetry monitor technician/nurse's primary responsibility is to continuously watch all the monitors at the central station. They cannot leave this post. If there is an issue with a client's signal or a concerning rhythm, their role is to immediately communicate this to the primary nurse assigned to that patient, who must then go and assess the patient directly.\n\nOption A: This is incorrect; the telemetry nurse cannot abandon the other monitors.\n\nOption C: The primary nurse should be notified first, as they are directly responsible for the patient. The charge nurse would be notified after an initial assessment if the situation is an emergency.\n\nOption D: Sending a crash cart is premature.

      "D": "Shout \"all clear\" prior to defibrillation."
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Safety is the absolute first priority during defibrillation. Oxygen is highly flammable, and an electrical spark from the defibrillator paddles or pads can ignite it, causing a fire and serious injury to both the patient and the resuscitation team. Therefore, the first action before delivering a shock is to remove the oxygen source (e.g., nasal cannula or face mask) and ensure it is not blowing across the patient's chest.\n\nThe options presented are all part of the process, but removing the oxygen source is the most critical first safety step.",
    "additional": "NCK Focus: Safety during emergency procedures is a paramount and frequently tested concept.\n\nShockable vs. Non-Shockable Rhythms:\nShockable: Ventricular Fibrillation (V-Fib) and pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia (V-Tach).\nNon-Shockable: Asystole and Pulseless Electrical Activity (PEA).\n\nOrder of Operations for Defibrillation:\n- Turn on defibrillator and apply pads.\n- Charge to 200J (biphasic) or 360J (monophasic).\n- Remove oxygen.\n- Shout \"all clear.\"\n- Deliver shock.\n- Resume CPR immediately."

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The telemetry strip shows Atrial Fibrillation (A-Fib). In A-Fib, the atria quiver chaotically instead of contracting normally, allowing blood to pool and form clots. These clots can travel to the brain and cause a stroke. Therefore, a primary treatment for chronic A-Fib is long-term anticoagulation with warfarin (Coumadin), which requires regular INR monitoring to maintain a therapeutic range (typically 2.0–3.0).",

    "explanation": "Epistaxis (nosebleed) and a flushed face are classic signs of a hypertensive crisis, a condition of severely elevated blood pressure. The first action for the nurse is to assess and confirm the blood pressure. This data is essential to determine the severity of the crisis and to guide all subsequent interventions.\n\nOption A: The nurse must assess before reporting; you need data to give the HCP.\nOption C: This is a good intervention, but it comes after or concurrently with the assessment.\nOption D: This is an intervention that requires an order and knowledge of the BP reading.",

      "D": "When I feel all right I do not need to take my medication."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Weight loss is a cornerstone of non-pharmacological management for hypertension. A goal of losing 2-3 pounds per week (though 1-2 is more standard) until a target weight loss is achieved demonstrates that the client understands the importance of weight management and has a concrete, actionable plan.\n\nOption A: Bacon is very high in sodium, a key substance to limit in hypertension.\nOption B: Exercise is recommended on most days of the week, not just once.\nOption D: This is a dangerous misconception. Hypertension is often asymptomatic (the \"silent killer\"), and medication must be taken consistently as prescribed to prevent long-term organ damage.",

      "B": "Question administering if the client's potassium level is less than 5.5 mEq/L.",
      "C": "Instruct the client to rise slowly from a lying to a sitting position.",
      "D": "Tell the client to drink 1000 mL of fluid daily."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "All antihypertensive medications, including diuretics like HCTZ, carry a risk of causing orthostatic hypotension (a sudden drop in blood pressure when standing up). This can lead to dizziness, lightheadedness, and falls. The most important safety instruction is to teach the client to change positions slowly.\n\nOption A: Checking the apical pulse is required for drugs that directly affect heart rate, like digoxin or beta-blockers, but not for a simple thiazide diuretic.\nOption B: This is incorrect. Thiazide diuretics are potassium-wasting diuretics. The nurse should be concerned if the potassium level is low (e.g., < 3.5 mEq/L), not high.\nOption D: A fluid restriction is not typically necessary unless there is co-existing severe heart failure.",
    "additional": "NCK Focus: Diuretics are a major drug class. You must know the difference between potassium-wasting and potassium-sparing types.\n\nPotassium-Wasting: Thiazides (HCTZ) and Loop diuretics (furosemide).

      "D": "The client who has an INR of 4.2."
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "An INR of 4.2 is a critical lab value. The therapeutic range for most conditions treated with warfarin (like A-Fib or DVT) is 2.0-3.0. A value of 4.2 indicates that the blood is dangerously thin, placing the client at extremely high risk for serious or fatal bleeding. The nurse must notify the HCP immediately so the warfarin dose can be held or adjusted, and an antidote (Vitamin K) can be considered.\n\nOption A: The ABG shows a compensated metabolic alkalosis (high HCO3 but normal pH). This is abnormal but not as immediately life-threatening as the critical INR.\nOption B: Potassium of 3.8 is within the normal range (3.5-5.0).\nOption C: Sodium of 138 is within the normal range (135-145).",
    "additional": "NCK Focus: Recognition and reporting of critical lab values is a fundamental nursing responsibility.

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This response directly addresses the client's misconception by explaining the asymptomatic nature of hypertension. It is often called the \"silent killer\" precisely because people can have dangerously high blood pressure without feeling any symptoms. This statement is factual, non-judgmental, and provides the core reason for medication adherence.\n\nOption B: This is paternalistic (\"doctor knows best\") and does not educate the client.\nOption C: While true, this is a fear-based tactic and less effective than directly explaining the \"silent\" nature of the disease in response to the client's specific comment.\nOption D: This is dangerous, incorrect advice that would put the client at risk.",
    "additional": "NCK Focus: Patient education for chronic, asymptomatic diseases is a key concept. The primary barrier to adherence is often the lack of symptoms.

Vital signs on an unstable patient require the assessment skills of a registered nurse.\nOption B: Assisting a client to smoke is unethical and contrary to health promotion.\nOption D: Clients scheduled for a cardiac catheterization are typically NPO (nothing by mouth) for 6–8 hours before the procedure to prevent aspiration. Helping this client eat would be a safety violation.",

      "B": "The client has a calcium level of 10.5 mg/dL.",
      "C": "The client reports having a dry mouth.",
      "D": "The client complains of being dizzy."
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Dizziness is a key symptom of hypotension. Since calcium channel blockers lower blood pressure, administering another dose to a client who is already feeling dizzy could dangerously lower their blood pressure further, leading to syncope and falls. The nurse must withhold the medication, assess the client's blood pressure, and notify the HCP.\n\nOption A: A BP of 110/70 is within the normal range and is often the target for a client being treated for hypertension. This would not be a reason to hold the medication.\nOption B: Calcium channel blockers do not directly affect serum calcium levels, nor does a slightly elevated calcium level (normal is ~8.5–10.2) contraindicate their use.\nOption C: Dry mouth can be a side effect of some medications but is not a contraindication to administration.",
    "additional": "NCK Focus: Medication safety and nursing judgment. The nurse's role is to assess the patient for therapeutic effects and adverse effects before administering a medication.

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "A blood pressure of 168/98 mmHg falls into the category of Stage 2 Hypertension. While this is significantly elevated and requires medical attention, the client is at a health fair and is likely asymptomatic. This does not constitute a hypertensive emergency requiring an immediate ER visit. The appropriate recommendation is to follow up with a primary care provider in the near future for evaluation and management. A timeframe of a few days is reasonable.\n\nOption B: An ER visit is reserved for hypertensive emergencies, where there is evidence of acute end-organ damage (e.g., chest pain, shortness of breath, severe headache, confusion).\nOption C: This is false and dangerous information.

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The combination of a significantly elevated blood pressure (164/92) and a headache is a red flag for a hypertensive crisis with potential end-organ damage (specifically, neurologic changes). The nurse cannot delegate assessment in this situation. The RN must personally assess the client immediately to perform a more detailed neurological assessment and confirm the vital signs.\n\nOption B: Simply medicating the headache without a full assessment is unsafe. The headache is a symptom of a more serious underlying problem.\nOption C: Delaying assessment is dangerous.\nOption D: The primary nurse is responsible for this patient; it is not appropriate to pass this responsibility to the charge nurse without first assessing the situation.",

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The client is in active distress (\"shortness of breath and dyspnea\"). The first action is a quick intervention to provide immediate relief. Elevating the head of the bed (placing the client in a high-Fowler's position) uses gravity to help reduce venous return to the heart (preload) and allows for better lung expansion, decreasing the work of breathing. This is the fastest and easiest way to improve the client's respiratory status.\n\nOptions A and D: These are assessments. While they must be done immediately, a simple positioning intervention can be done first or simultaneously to provide relief.\nOption C: Administering oxygen is also a key intervention, but positioning is often done first as it provides an immediate mechanical advantage for breathing.",

    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The absolute rule before administering any dose of digoxin is to check the apical pulse for one full minute. Digoxin slows the heart rate by acting on the AV node. If the heart rate is already too slow (typically <60 bpm for an adult), the medication must be held, and the HCP notified to prevent life-threatening bradycardia.\n\nOption A: Checking the potassium level is extremely important because hypokalemia (low potassium) potentiates digoxin toxicity. However, the immediate safety check right before administration is the heart rate.\nOption B: Digoxin primarily affects heart rate and contractility, not blood pressure directly.\nOption C: A digoxin level is checked to monitor for toxicity, but it reflects past doses, not whether the next dose is safe to give. A level would not be available before the initial dose anyway.",
    "additional": "NCK Focus: Medication safety for high-alert drugs. Digoxin is a classic example. You must know:\n- The critical pre-administration assessment: Apical pulse for 1 minute, hold if <60 bpm.\n- The relationship with potassium: Hypokalemia increases the risk of toxicity.\n- Signs of Toxicity: Nausea, vomiting, anorexia, visual disturbances (yellow/green halos), and arrhythmias (especially bradycardia)."

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Leg cramps in a client taking a diuretic (\"water pill\"), such as furosemide or HCTZ, are a classic symptom of hypokalemia (low potassium). This is a potentially dangerous electrolyte imbalance that can lead to cardiac dysrhythmias, especially if the client is also taking digoxin. This finding requires immediate follow-up assessment and reporting to the HCP.\n\nOption A: Taking the diuretic in the morning is correct practice to avoid nocturia.\nOption B: Sleeping on two pillows (orthopnea) is a common symptom of heart failure, but it reflects the chronic condition, not an acute problem requiring immediate intervention.\nOption D: Activity intolerance is also an expected symptom of CHF.",

    "explanation": "Furosemide is a powerful loop diuretic used in CHF to remove excess fluid from the body. A primary symptom of fluid overload in CHF is pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs), which is heard as crackles on auscultation. Clear lung sounds indicate that the diuretic has been effective in pulling fluid out of the pulmonary circulation, thus improving the client's respiratory status.\n\nOption A: 300 mL in 8 hours is low output. A brisk diuresis is expected.\nOption C: A weight loss of 1 kg over 2 days is a positive sign but less indicative of acute effectiveness than clear lungs.\nOption D: While diuretics can lower BP, this is not the primary indicator of the drug's effect on fluid volume status.",

This leads to:\n- Intermittent Claudication: Ischemic muscle pain with activity.\n- Cool Extremities: Lack of warm, oxygenated arterial blood.\nOther signs include weak/absent pulses, pallor, and hair loss on the legs.\n\nOption B: Brisk capillary refill and strong pulses indicate excellent perfusion, opposite of PAD.\nOption C: Pitting edema is more indicative of venous insufficiency.\nOption D: \"Alligator\" skin is associated with chronic venous insufficiency.",
    "additional": "NCK Focus: Differentiating PAD vs PVD is essential.\n- PAD: Pale, cool, pulseless legs. Pain with activity (claudication). Ulcers on toes.\n- PVD: Edematous, discolored, warm legs. Pain relieved by elevation. Ulcers on ankles."

      "D": "I should not cross my legs when I am sitting down."
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Crossing the legs compresses the arteries and veins, further impeding blood flow to the lower extremities. Avoiding this position promotes circulation in PVD.\n\nOption A: Feet swell during the day, so shoes should be bought in the afternoon.\nOption B: Heating pads pose a burn risk for those with decreased sensation (neuropathy).\nOption C: Tight elastic bands on knee-high socks may restrict circulation and should be avoided.",
    "additional": "NCK Focus: Safety teaching for PVD focuses on foot care: inspect feet daily, wear protective shoes, test water temp before bathing, avoid crossing legs, and seek podiatric care as needed."

      "D": "Recommend going to the podiatrist for nail cutting."
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "In venous insufficiency, incompetent valves lead to pooling of blood in the lower extremities. Elevating the legs helps gravity return blood to the heart, reducing edema and improving symptoms.\n\nOption B: A low-sodium diet helps with general fluid management but elevation directly addresses venous pooling.\nOption C: Open-toed shoes do not protect the feet from injury.\nOption D: Podiatry care is more critical for arterial disease or diabetes unless venous disease is complicated by neuropathy.",
    "additional": "NCK Focus: Management of venous insufficiency centers around elevation and compression. Compression stockings and frequent leg elevation are foundational interventions."

    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "After a fem-pop bypass, priority care includes frequent neurovascular assessments to monitor graft patency. The nurse must assess for the 6 P's: Pain, Pallor, Pulselessness, Paresthesia, Paralysis, and Poikilothermia. Paresthesia or paralysis suggests compromised perfusion and requires immediate action.\n\nOption A: A dependent position can increase edema and compromise graft perfusion.\nOption B: Abductor pillows are used after hip replacement, not vascular surgery.\nOption C: CPM machines are used after knee replacement.",
    "additional": "NCK Focus: Post-op care of vascular grafts involves frequent assessment of the affected extremity (initially every 15 minutes, then hourly). Sudden changes in neurovascular status are surgical emergencies."

      "D": "The UAP assisted the client with venous insufficiency to put on antiembolic hose."
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "For a client with arterial occlusive disease (PAD), blood flow to the legs is compromised. Elevating the legs works against gravity and will further decrease arterial blood flow, worsening ischemia and pain. The correct position for a client with PAD is to keep the legs neutral or in a slightly dependent (hanging down) position to enhance blood flow. The nurse must intervene to correct this action.\n\nOptions B, C, and D: These are all appropriate actions for a UAP. Using a gait belt is a safety measure, sitting in a chair for meals prevents aspiration, and applying compression hose is a key intervention for venous insufficiency.",
    "additional": "NCK Focus: This question again tests the crucial difference between arterial and venous disease management.\n- Arterial (PAD): Keep legs Down (Dependent) to improve perfusion.\n- Venous (PVD): Elevate the legs to reduce Edema.\nThe nurse is responsible for supervising the UAP and must intervene if an unsafe or incorrect action is performed."

      "C": "The client has numbness and tingling of the legs.",
      "D": "The client has cool, pale extremities."
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The development of rest pain is a critical finding in arterial occlusive disease. It signifies a progression to severe limb ischemia, where blood flow is not sufficient to meet the metabolic demands of the tissues even at rest. This indicates the limb is in jeopardy and requires urgent intervention (such as a bypass graft or angioplasty) to prevent tissue necrosis and potential amputation.\n\nOptions A, C, and D: Weak pulses (1+), paresthesias (numbness/tingling), and cool, pale extremities are all expected, chronic signs of PAD. While they need to be documented and monitored, rest pain represents an acute worsening of the condition that requires immediate reporting.",
    "additional": "NCK Focus: Staging of Peripheral Arterial Disease:\n- Stage I: Asymptomatic\n- Stage II: Intermittent Claudication (pain with exercise)\n- Stage III: Rest Pain (critical limb ischemia)\n- Stage IV: Necrosis/Gangrene (critical limb ischemia)\nRecognizing the transition from claudication to rest pain is key to identifying a patient who needs urgent vascular intervention."

      "C": "Explain how to prevent orthostatic hypotension.",
      "D": "Tell the client to take acetaminophen four times a day."
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "A structured walking program is a cornerstone of conservative management for PAD. Walking to the point of claudication, resting, and then walking again helps to build collateral circulation (small new blood vessels that bypass the blockages). This improves oxygen delivery to the muscles over time and can increase the distance the client can walk without pain.\n\nOption B: Increasing fluid intake is not a primary intervention for PAD.\nOption C: Orthostatic hypotension is not a typical problem associated with PAD.\nOption D: Acetaminophen is not prescribed for PAD; it does not treat the underlying ischemic problem.",
    "additional": "NCK Focus: Conservative vs. surgical management of PAD. The first line of treatment involves risk factor modification (smoking cessation, diet), a structured exercise program, and medications to improve blood flow and prevent clots."

      "C": "Monitor the popliteal and pedal pulses daily.",
      "D": "Perform passive range-of-motion exercise daily."
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Clients with chronic venous insufficiency have edema and fragile, poorly nourished skin. Sensation may also be decreased. Because of this, they are at high risk for developing skin breakdown and venous stasis ulcers, which are very difficult to heal. Daily inspection of the feet is a critical safety measure to catch any cuts, blisters, or red areas early before they develop into a serious ulcer.\n\nOption A: Aspirin is an antiplatelet agent used to prevent clots in arterial disease, not venous insufficiency.\nOption C: Monitoring pulses is an assessment for arterial perfusion.\nOption D: Active range-of-motion or ambulation is preferred. Passive ROM is for immobile clients.",

      "C": "Use a Doppler to assess for pedal pulse.",
      "D": "Assess for proximal pulses bilaterally."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "If a peripheral pulse cannot be palpated, the first action is to use a more sensitive tool to confirm the finding. A vascular Doppler uses ultrasound to detect blood flow. It is the standard next step to determine if a pulse is truly absent or just weak and non-palpable.\n\nOption A: Do not notify the HCP until you have confirmed your finding with a Doppler.\nOption B: This is an intervention, not an assessment.\nOption D: Assessing proximal pulses is reasonable, but confirming the original pulse is the priority.",

      "D": "Increased plaque in your arteries is the cause of peripheral vascular disease."
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This is the most accurate and simple explanation. Arterial occlusive disease is caused by atherosclerosis, which is the buildup of fatty plaque in the arteries. This plaque narrows the vessels and restricts blood flow, causing the signs and symptoms of the disease.\n\nOption A: Incompetent valves cause venous insufficiency.\nOption B: Standing for long periods is a risk factor for venous disease.\nOption C: The cause of arterial disease is well-established as atherosclerosis.",

      "C": "Rebound tenderness and protruding umbilicus.",
      "D": "Hard rigid abdomen and low-grade fever."
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The two classic physical assessment findings of an AAA are:\n- A palpable, pulsatile mass in the abdomen, typically in the mid-epigastric area slightly to the left of the midline.\n- An abdominal bruit (a swooshing sound heard with the bell of the stethoscope over the aneurysm) caused by turbulent blood flow through the dilated aorta.\n\nOption A: Visible peristalsis can be a sign of a bowel obstruction.\nOption C: Rebound tenderness is a sign of peritoneal inflammation (peritonitis).\nOption D: A hard, rigid abdomen is a sign of peritonitis or internal bleeding.",
    "additional": "NCK Focus: Abdominal assessment findings. You must be able to link specific findings to the correct underlying pathology.\n\nSafety Note: If an AAA is suspected or known, the nurse should avoid deep palpation of the abdomen, as this could cause the aneurysm to rupture."

      "D": "You will need to have an abdominal aortic aneurysm repair within 2 weeks."
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "A small AAA (typically defined as < 5.0 - 5.5 cm in diameter) is managed conservatively with \"watchful waiting.\" This involves regular imaging (usually with an ultrasound every 6 to 12 months) to monitor for any growth. Surgical repair is typically not considered until the aneurysm reaches a size where the risk of rupture outweighs the risks of surgery.\n\nOption B: An endoscopy is used to visualize the GI tract, not the aorta.\nOption C: Checking abdominal girth is for monitoring ascites, not an AAA.\nOption D: Surgery is not indicated for a small, 3-cm aneurysm.",
    "additional": "NCK Focus: Management of AAA based on size.\n- Small AAA (<5.5 cm): \"Watchful waiting\" with serial imaging (ultrasound) and aggressive risk factor modification (especially blood pressure control and smoking cessation).\n- Large AAA (>5.5 cm) or symptomatic/rapidly expanding AAA: Surgical repair is indicated."

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The sudden onset of new back or abdominal pain in a client with a known AAA is a classic sign that the aneurysm may be rapidly expanding or beginning to leak/rupture. This is a surgical emergency. The aneurysm can press on the lumbar nerves, causing this pain. The nurse must notify the surgeon immediately.\n\nOption B: This suggests a urinary/prostate issue.\nOption C: This suggests a GI issue.\nOption D: Feeling a \"heartbeat\" in the abdomen is a common, chronic symptom of an AAA and is not an emergency in itself. The new onset of pain is the critical finding.",

    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The absence of a pedal pulse after an AAA repair is a critical sign that the graft may have become occluded with a thrombus, or that an embolus has traveled down to the lower extremity. This constitutes an acute arterial occlusion, a surgical emergency that can lead to limb loss if not addressed immediately. The nurse must notify the surgeon at once.\n\nOption A: Refusing ROM is a psychosocial or mobility issue, not an acute life-threatening problem.\nOption B: 300 mL of urine in 8 hours is 37.5 mL/hour, which is adequate (>30 mL/hr) and indicates sufficient renal perfusion.\nOption D: These vital signs are stable and within normal limits for a postoperative client.",
    "additional": "NCK Focus: Postoperative complications of AAA repair. The highest priorities are monitoring for hemorrhage (at the graft site) and graft occlusion.\n\nGraft Occlusion Assessment: Perform frequent neurovascular checks on the lower extremities, assessing the \"6 P's\" (Pain, Pallor, Pulselessness, Paresthesia, Paralysis, Poikilothermia).

      "C": "Encourage the client to splint the incision.",
      "D": "Ambulate the client in the room with assistance."
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The nursing process dictates that assessment is the first step. Following an open AAA repair, which involves extensive abdominal surgery and manipulation of the bowel, there is a high risk of developing a paralytic ileus (a temporary cessation of peristalsis). Therefore, the nurse's first action during a head-to-toe assessment is to assess for the presence and quality of bowel sounds.\n\nOptions B, C, and D: These are all appropriate interventions for a postoperative client, but they follow the initial assessment. You must assess the client's status before implementing these actions.",
    "additional": "NCK Focus: This is a classic \"nursing process\" question. Assessment always comes first.\n\nPost-op GI Complications: Besides graft failure, a major complication of open AAA repair is paralytic ileus. Signs include absent bowel sounds, abdominal distention, and nausea/vomiting. The client is kept NPO until bowel sounds return."

      "C": "Bedrest with bathroom privileges.",
      "D": "Start intravenous line with normal saline."
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Administering an enema, particularly \"until clear,\" involves instilling a large volume of fluid into the colon. This significantly increases intra-abdominal pressure. In a client with a known AAA, this increased pressure could cause the aneurysm to rupture, a catastrophic event. This order is dangerous and must be questioned by the nurse.\n\nOptions A, C, and D: These are all standard and appropriate pre-operative orders for a major vascular surgery. A CBC is needed for baseline labs, bedrest minimizes exertion, and an IV line is essential for fluids and medications.",
    "additional": "NCK Focus: Patient safety and acting as a patient advocate. The nurse must recognize and question any order that could place the patient in immediate danger.

    "explanation": "The combination of hypotension (BP 92/68) and tachycardia (pulse 114) are the classic signs of hypovolemic shock. In a client who just had a major vascular surgery, this most likely indicates hemorrhage from a leak at the graft site. This is a life-threatening emergency requiring immediate intervention.\n\nOption B: Severe pain is expected and needs to be treated, but it is not as immediately life-threatening as hemodynamic collapse.\nOption C: A soft, nondistended abdomen is a normal finding. Tenderness is expected.\nOption D: Green bile draining from an NG tube is an expected finding, as the tube is placed to decompress the stomach.",

For long-term DVT management, clients are discharged on an oral anticoagulant like warfarin, which is monitored by PT/INR.\nOption C: Green leafy vegetables are high in Vitamin K, which is the antidote to warfarin. Clients on warfarin should be taught to maintain a consistent, not high, intake of Vitamin K. Red-tinted urine is a sign of bleeding (hematuria) and must be reported immediately.\nOption D: Stockings with a tight elastic band at the top can act as a tourniquet and impede circulation, which is dangerous.

    "explanation": "Care for a client with an acute DVT focuses on preventing complications and promoting comfort.\n\nHose on unaffected leg: Placing a compression hose on the unaffected leg helps prevent a new DVT from forming in that leg due to inactivity.\n\nFluids and fiber: Bedrest and anticoagulants can lead to constipation. Encouraging fluids and a high-fiber (roughage) diet helps to prevent this.\n\nAssess unaffected leg: It is crucial to monitor the unaffected leg for signs of a new DVT (tenderness, swelling, redness).\n\nIncorrect Options:\nOption 2: A client with an acute DVT is typically placed on strict bedrest for several days to prevent the clot from dislodging. Frequent ambulation is contraindicated.\nOption 4: An IV site, especially one infusing a high-risk medication like heparin, must be monitored much more frequently than every 24 hours (e.g., every 1–2 hours) for signs of infiltration or phlebitis.",

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This is the standard, evidence-based practice for transitioning from IV heparin to oral warfarin. It is called bridging therapy. Warfarin takes several days (3–5 days) to reach a therapeutic level (measured by INR). During this time, the client is still at risk for clotting. Therefore, the heparin drip is continued concurrently with the warfarin until the INR is in the therapeutic range (usually 2.0–3.0) for at least 24 hours. The nurse should administer both medications as ordered.\n\nOption A: Checking labs is important but is not the first action. The first action is to understand that the orders are correct and should be carried out.\nOption B: Calling the HCP is unnecessary as the orders are correct.\nOption D: Discontinuing the heparin before the warfarin is therapeutic would leave the client unprotected from clotting and is a dangerous medication error.",

      "C": "Fourth intercostal space, left axillary line.",
      "D": "Fifth intercostal space, midclavicular line."
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The best location to auscultate for mitral valve sounds is at the apex of the heart, located at the fifth intercostal space, midclavicular line. This is where mitral regurgitation murmurs are heard loudest.\n\nOption A: This is the aortic area.\nOption B: Erb’s point can detect murmurs but is not specific to mitral valve pathology.\nOption C: This is not a recognized auscultation landmark.",
    "additional": "NCK Focus: Master the five cardiac auscultation landmarks using the mnemonic APE To Man: Aortic (2nd ICS RSB), Pulmonic (2nd ICS LSB), Erb’s Point (3rd ICS LSB), Tricuspid (4th ICS LSB), Mitral (5th ICS MCL)."

    "question": "The nurse is assisting with a synchronized cardioversion on a client in atrial fibrillation. Which statement by the client indicates the client understands the pre-procedure teaching?",
    "options": {
      "A": "This procedure will cure my atrial fibrillation problems for good.",
      "B": "I should be able to eat breakfast before the procedure.",
      "C": "I will be given some medication to relax me before the procedure.",
      "D": "I won't need to be hooked up to telemetry after the procedure."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Clients undergoing synchronized cardioversion are sedated with medications like midazolam to minimize discomfort. Acknowledging this medication indicates understanding of the procedure.\n\nOption A: Atrial fibrillation can recur post-cardioversion.\nOption B: Patients must be NPO before sedation.\nOption D: Telemetry monitoring is necessary after the procedure.",
    "additional": "NCK Focus: Cardioversion (for clients with a pulse) is synchronized and requires sedation. Defibrillation (for pulseless arrhythmias) is unsynchronized and performed emergently."

    "question": "The nurse is reviewing HCP orders on a client diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) who is scheduled for surgery in the morning. Which order should the nurse question?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Administer bisacodyl (Dulcolax), a cathartic laxative, on admission to the unit.",
      "B": "Send an intravenous piggyback (IVPB) antibiotic to surgery with the client.",
      "C": "Have the client bathe using an iodine preparation at night and in the morning.",
      "D": "Elevate the head of the bed at 45°."
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Bisacodyl is a stimulant laxative that increases intra-abdominal pressure, which can precipitate rupture of an AAA. This order should be questioned for safety.\n\nOptions B, C, and D: These are all standard and appropriate pre-op measures.",
    "additional": "NCK Focus: Nurses must recognize contraindications to orders. Any intervention that increases intra-abdominal pressure (e.g., straining, intense peristalsis) is dangerous in clients with aneurysms."
  },
  {
    "question": "The nurse is admitting a client with a suspected myocardial infarction who was brought in by ambulance. Which nursing intervention has priority?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Ask if the client is allergic to aspirin.",
      "B": "Place the client on the telemetry monitor.",
      "C": "Notify the cardiac catheterization lab.",
      "D": "Have the client sign for permission to treat."
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Aspirin is part of the first-line treatment in suspected MI to inhibit platelet aggregation. Asking about allergies is essential before administration. This intervention can be done immediately and directly contributes to treatment.\n\nOption B: Important but not as immediate as prepping for aspirin.\nOption C: Requires ECG confirmation.\nOption D: Not required in emergencies—treatment can proceed under implied consent.",
    "additional": "NCK Focus: MONA protocol for MI: Morphine, Oxygen, Nitroglycerin, Aspirin. Prioritize interventions that reduce infarct size quickly—start with what can be safely administered."
  },
  {
    "question": "The nurse is preparing to administer daily medications. Which medication would the nurse question?",
    "options": {
      "A": "The ACE inhibitor to the client who tells the nurse his cough has gone away.",
      "B": "The calcium channel blocker to the client who states an allergy to calcium.",
      "C": "The beta blocker to the client who has a BP of 156/94 and a pulse of 58.",
      "D": "The antidysrhythmic medication to the client in normal sinus rhythm."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Beta-blockers slow heart rate. A pulse below 60 bpm is considered bradycardic, and administering the medication could cause harm. This medication should be held and the provider notified.\n\nOption A: A resolved ACE inhibitor cough is not a contraindication.\nOption B: Elemental calcium allergies are not relevant to calcium channel blockers.\nOption D: Antiarrhythmics are often used prophylactically.",
    "additional": "NCK Focus: Medication safety parameters are vital. Nurses must hold medications like beta-blockers if HR < 60 bpm or digoxin in the same context. Always assess vitals prior to administration."

    "question": "The client admitted with deep vein thrombosis is prescribed heparin by constant infusion after an initial dose of 5000 units intravenous push. The heparin comes prepared 20,000 units in 500 mL of D5W. The bolus heparin was administered at 0800 and the infusion initiated per protocol at 25 mL/hr. At the 1900 shift change, how much heparin had been administered?",
    "options": {
      "A": "5,440 units",
      "B": "11,000 units",
      "C": "16,000 units",
      "D": "20,000 units"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The infusion ran for 11 hours at 25 mL/hr. Heparin concentration is 40 units/mL (20,000 units / 500 mL). Infused dose = 25 mL/hr x 11 hr = 275 mL x 40 units/mL = 11,000 units. Add bolus dose: 11,000 + 5,000 = 16,000 units total.\n\nIncorrect Option A: This is a miscalculated answer that omits the infusion rate.\nOption B: Misses the bolus dose.\nOption D: Would imply the entire bag was infused.",
    "additional": "NCK Focus: Proper IV drug calculation requires knowledge of flow rate, concentration, and infusion time. Always double-check calculations for continuous infusions and include both bolus and drip components."
