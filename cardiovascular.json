      "B": "Anemia",
      "C": "Hypotension",
      "D": "Hypocalcemia"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Patients with ESRD are unable to excrete sodium and water effectively. This leads to chronic fluid volume excess, which is a primary cause of hypertension. Therefore, hypotension would not be an expected finding unless the patient was experiencing a separate acute event like sepsis or hemorrhage.",
    "additional": "Why A, B, and D are incorrect:\nA. Edema: Caused by fluid volume excess.\nB. Anemia: In ESRD, erythropoietin production ceases, leading to chronic anemia.\nD. Hypocalcemia: Due to failure to activate Vitamin D, which reduces calcium absorption.\n\nAdditional Possible Content to be Tested Next:\n- Hyperkalemia: Due to decreased excretion of potassium.\n- Hyperphosphatemia: Due to decreased excretion of phosphate.\n- Metabolic Acidosis: Inability to excrete hydrogen ions.\n- Uremia: Accumulation of nitrogenous waste causing pruritus, nausea, encephalopathy."

      "C": "Early clinical indicators of shock",
      "D": "Fall in sympathetic nervous system discharge"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The initial vital signs (tachycardia, hypertension, tachypnea) are typical of sympathetic nervous system activation in response to stress or pain. Cleansing and reassurance lowered anxiety, which reduced the stimulus for this response. As a result, sympathetic discharge decreased and parasympathetic tone was restored, leading to normalization of the client's vital signs.",
    "additional": "Why A, B, and C are incorrect:\nA & B: Environmental effects like cooling or air conditioning would not produce rapid, system-wide changes in vitals.\nC: Shock involves worsening vital signs such as increasing tachycardia and falling blood pressure. This client’s vitals improved.\n\nAdditional Possible Content to be Tested Next:\n- Sympathetic Nervous System: Triggers fight-or-flight, increases HR, BP, RR.\n- Parasympathetic Nervous System: Calms the body, lowers HR and RR, enhances digestion.\n- Nursing Techniques for Anxiety Reduction: Reassurance, calm communication, deep breathing, and environment control."

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "A prominent U wave is the hallmark EKG finding of hypokalemia, not hyperkalemia. This makes it the correct 'except' answer in the context of hyperkalemia-related changes.",
    "additional": "Why A, B, and D are incorrect:\n- A: Tall peaked T waves are the earliest sign of hyperkalemia.\n- B & D: As potassium increases, P waves flatten and may disappear, and the QRS complex widens.\n\nIf left untreated, these changes progress to a sine wave pattern that precedes cardiac arrest.\n\nMore on Hyperkalemia:\n- Causes: Renal failure, potassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, tissue damage (e.g., rhabdomyolysis).\n- Symptoms: Muscle weakness, flaccid paralysis, cardiac arrhythmias.\n- Emergency Treatment (Mnemonic: C BIG K DiE):\n  • Calcium gluconate to stabilize the cardiac membrane.\n  • Beta-agonist or bicarbonate to shift K+ intracellularly.\n  • Insulin and glucose to drive K+ into cells.\n  • Kayexalate or diuretics to remove K+.\n  • Dialysis for definitive treatment."

      "D": "Assess the fistula for the presence of a bruit and thrill every 4 hours"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The nurse must assess the AV fistula regularly to ensure it remains patent. Palpating for a thrill and auscultating for a bruit every 4 hours helps identify thrombosis early, which can prevent access failure. This is a vital safety intervention in clients undergoing hemodialysis.",
    "additional": "Why A, B, and C are incorrect:\n- A & B: Never use the fistula arm for BP, IVs, or blood draws. This risks clotting or damaging the access.\n- C: Clamps should never be attached to an AV fistula dressing as this can interfere with flow.\n\nMore on AV Access:\n- Fistula: Direct connection of an artery and vein. Preferred for long-term use.\n- Graft: Synthetic tube between artery and vein. Used when veins are unsuitable.\n\nPatient Education:\n- Avoid tight clothing or jewelry on the access arm.\n- Don’t sleep on the access arm.\n- Report absence of thrill, redness, or pain immediately.\n- No BP, IVs, or blood draws on the access side."

    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Rationale for the Correct Answer (C): The key findings are a new systolic murmur heard at the cardiac apex in a client who recently had a myocardial infarction (MI).\n\nThe cardiac apex (usually the 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line) is the best location to auscultate the mitral valve.\n\nA systolic murmur heard here indicates mitral regurgitation—blood is leaking backward from the left ventricle into the left atrium during ventricular contraction (systole).\n\nAn MI can cause ischemia and necrosis of the papillary muscles, which are responsible for holding the leaflets of the mitral valve closed during systole. When these muscles are damaged or rupture, they can no longer do their job, leading to acute, severe mitral regurgitation. This is a life-threatening mechanical complication of an MI. The nurse must assess for signs of pulmonary edema (dyspnea, crackles) and cardiogenic shock (hypotension, tachycardia, decreased urine output) and notify the provider immediately.",
    "additional": "Why Other Options are Incorrect:\n\nA: Ventricular aneurysm is a late complication of MI (weeks to months later) and does not typically cause a new systolic murmur at the apex shortly after an MI.\n\nB: Acute pericarditis typically presents with a pericardial friction rub and sharp chest pain, not a murmur. The pain is usually relieved by leaning forward.\n\nD: Pulmonary embolism does not cause a murmur at the apex and presents with dyspnea, pleuritic pain, and tachycardia.\n\nAdditional Content & Potential Future Questions:\n\nKey Complications of Myocardial Infarction:\n\n1.

      "A": "Ventricular aneurysm",
      "B": "Acute pericarditis",
      "C": "Papillary muscle dysfunction",
      "D": "Pulmonary embolism"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The key components in the question are a recent MI, a new systolic murmur, and its location at the cardiac apex. This clinical picture is a classic sign of acute mitral regurgitation caused by papillary muscle dysfunction or rupture.\n\nPathophysiology: The papillary muscles are attached to the mitral valve leaflets via the chordae tendineae. They contract during systole to prevent the valve from prolapsing back into the left atrium. An MI, particularly one affecting the inferior or posterior walls of the heart, can disrupt the blood supply to these muscles, causing them to become ischemic and dysfunctional, or even to rupture.\n\nResulting Murmur: When the papillary muscle is dysfunctional, the mitral valve cannot close completely during ventricular contraction (systole). This allows a jet of blood to flow backward (regurgitate) from the high-pressure left ventricle into the lower-pressure left atrium. This turbulent backflow is what creates the 'whooshing' sound of a new, loud systolic murmur, which is best auscultated at the cardiac apex (the location of the mitral valve, typically the 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line). This is a serious, often life-threatening complication that leads to acute pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock.\n\nRationale for Incorrect Options:\n\n(A) Ventricular aneurysm: This is a late complication of an MI, typically occurring weeks to months later. It is a thinned, bulging section of the ventricular wall that can impair contractility but does not characteristically cause a new, acute systolic murmur at the apex.\n\n(B) Acute pericarditis: This is inflammation of the pericardial sac, which can occur 2 to 3 days post-MI. Its hallmark sign is a pericardial friction rub, a scratching, grating, high-pitched sound, not a systolic murmur. The pain is also characteristic—sharp, pleuritic, and often relieved by leaning forward.\n\n(D) Pulmonary embolism: This involves a clot obstructing the pulmonary artery. It presents with sudden dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, and tachycardia. It does not cause a murmur at the cardiac apex.",
    "additional": "Immediate Nursing Action: After identifying this new murmur, the nurse's priority is to assess for signs of cardiogenic shock and pulmonary edema. This includes checking for hypotension, tachycardia, crackles on lung auscultation, dyspnea, and confusion. The nurse must notify the physician immediately, as this is a surgical emergency.\n\nOther Mechanical Complications of MI:\n\n- Ventricular Septal Rupture: Causes a new, loud, harsh holosystolic murmur heard at the left sternal border. It leads to a left-to-right shunt, causing severe heart failure.\n- Cardiac Rupture: A catastrophic event leading to cardiac tamponade and rapid clinical deterioration.\n\nOther General Complications of MI:\n\n- Dysrhythmias (most common)\n- Heart failure\n- Cardiogenic shock\n\nBrunner & Suddarth's Textbook of Medical-Surgical Nursing (14th Ed.)

      "A": "Exercise",
      "B": "obesity",
      "C": "stress",
      "D": "heredity"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Risk factors for diseases are categorized as either modifiable (controllable) or non-modifiable (uncontrollable).\n\nNon-modifiable (Uncontrollable) Risk Factors: These are factors that a person cannot change. Heredity, or family history, is a primary non-modifiable risk factor for CAD. Having a first-degree relative (parent, sibling) with cardiovascular disease at an early age (before 55 for men, before 65 for women) significantly increases an individual's own risk.\n\nModifiable (Controllable) Risk Factors: These are lifestyle factors and conditions that a person can take measures to change or manage.\n\nRationale for Incorrect Options:\n\n(A) Exercise: Lack of exercise (physical inactivity) is a modifiable risk factor. Increasing exercise helps control weight, blood pressure, and cholesterol.\n\n(B) obesity: Obesity is a significant modifiable risk factor. Weight loss can dramatically reduce the risk of CAD.\n\n(C) stress: While difficult to manage, stress is considered a modifiable risk factor. Patients can learn coping mechanisms and relaxation techniques to reduce its impact.",

      "B": "Impaired skin integrity related to pressure",
      "C": "Activity intolerance related to pump failure",
      "D": "Constipation related to immobility"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "If we must choose from the given options, (C) Activity intolerance related to pump failure is a significant issue. However, acute pulmonary edema is a life-threatening situation where breathing is the primary concern. The true priority diagnosis would be Impaired Gas Exchange. Since it's not an option, we must re-evaluate. Let's analyze the options as they are written.\n\n(C) Activity intolerance is certainly a correct diagnosis for heart failure. The failing pump cannot supply enough oxygenated blood to meet the body's demands during exertion, causing fatigue and dyspnea. While important, it is not the priority in an acute pulmonary edema crisis. In an acute crisis, the patient cannot even tolerate being at rest, let alone being active.\n\n(A) Risk for infection (like pneumonia) is a valid concern due to fluid stasis in the lungs, but it is a potential problem that develops over time, not the immediate life-threatening issue.\n\n(B) Impaired skin integrity is a risk for patients with heart failure due to edema and immobility, but it is not an acute priority.\n\n(D) Constipation is a minor issue compared to the life-threatening respiratory distress of pulmonary edema.",
    "additional": "Rationale for the True Priority (Impaired Gas Exchange): Pulmonary edema is the accumulation of fluid in the alveoli and interstitial spaces of the lungs. This fluid barrier prevents oxygen and carbon dioxide from moving effectively between the alveoli and the capillaries. This leads to severe dyspnea, hypoxemia (low blood oxygen), and is a medical emergency. Therefore, Impaired Gas Exchange is the absolute highest priority nursing diagnosis, as it relates directly to the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation).\n\nSigns of Pulmonary Edema: Classic signs include severe dyspnea, feeling of suffocation, tachypnea, tachycardia, anxiety, confusion, and pink, frothy sputum. On auscultation, you will hear diffuse crackles (rales).\n\nPriority Nursing Interventions for Pulmonary Edema:\n- Positioning: Place the patient in a high-Fowler's position with legs dangling, if possible. This helps reduce venous return to the heart and allows for better lung expansion.\n- Oxygen: Administer high-flow oxygen via a non-rebreather mask to improve oxygenation.\n\nMedications (as ordered):\n- Diuretics (IV Furosemide): To rapidly remove excess fluid.\n- Vasodilators (Nitroglycerin): To reduce preload and afterload.\n- Morphine: To reduce anxiety, preload, and the work of breathing.\n\nMonitoring: Continuously monitor vital signs, oxygen saturation, and lung sounds.\n\nHow NCK Might Test This:\nThey will ask for the priority nursing action, the priority assessment finding to report, or the expected outcome of a medication like furosemide. Always choose the option that addresses the most immediate life-threat (impaired gas exchange).\n\nTextbook Reference:\nBrunner & Suddarth's Textbook of Medical-Surgical Nursing, 14th Ed., Chapter 28: Management of Patients With Structural, Infectious, and Inflammatory Cardiac Disorders.

      "C": "Delay release of calcium from intracellular reservoirs",
      "D": "Reduce peripheral resistance & venous return"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Morphine has two primary hemodynamic effects that are beneficial in acute pulmonary edema:\n\n- Venodilation: It dilates the peripheral veins, which causes blood to pool in the extremities. This reduces venous return to the heart (decreases preload). A lower preload means the struggling left ventricle has less blood to pump, which alleviates congestion in the pulmonary circulation.\n\n- Arterial Vasodilation: It causes mild dilation of arteries, which reduces systemic vascular resistance (decreases afterload). This makes it easier for the heart to pump blood forward.\n\nBy reducing both preload and afterload, morphine decreases the workload on the heart and helps resolve pulmonary congestion.",
    "additional": "Analysis of Incorrect Options:\n\n(A) Morphine does not have a direct diuretic effect. That is the function of diuretics like furosemide.\n\n(B) Morphine relieves dyspnea indirectly, but does not directly relieve hypoxemia. The physiological mechanism is reduced preload/afterload.\n\n(C) Morphine does not affect intracellular calcium in cardiac cells. That role belongs to calcium channel blockers.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n- Morphine also reduces anxiety, which breaks the catecholamine-induced cycle of tachycardia and oxygen demand.\n- Monitor for respiratory depression.

    "question": "Sympathetic stimulation of the cardiovascular system causes:",
    "options": {
      "A": "Increased heart rate and constriction of coronary arteries",
      "B": "Constriction of GIT secretory gland vessels with increased flow of digestive juices.",
      "C": "Increased peripheral resistance and dilatation of coronary arteries",
      "D": "Increased force of heart contraction & reduced peripheral resistance."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Sympathetic stimulation prepares the body for a fight-or-flight response. It causes vasoconstriction in peripheral arteries, increasing peripheral resistance and blood pressure. It also causes coronary artery dilation to ensure more oxygen is delivered to the heart muscle, which is working harder during this response.",
    "additional": "Incorrect Options:\n(A) Heart rate increases, but coronary arteries dilate, not constrict.\n(B) SNS decreases GI blood flow and secretions.\n(D) SNS increases contractility but also increases peripheral resistance.\n\nReceptor Summary:\n- Alpha-1: Vasoconstriction (skin, GI, kidneys)\n- Beta-1: ↑ HR, ↑ contractility\n- Beta-2: Bronchodilation, skeletal muscle vasodilation\n\nPharmacology Link: Beta-blockers reduce HR and contractility by blocking Beta-1.\n\nTextbook Reference: Brunner & Suddarth, 14th Ed., Chapter 25"

      "C": "Bradycardia and Kussmaul breathing",
      "D": "Oliguria and narrow pulse pressure."
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Widening pulse pressure and irregular respirations are classic signs of Cushing’s Triad, which indicates increased intracranial pressure and possible brainstem herniation.",
    "additional": "Cushing’s Triad:\n- Hypertension with widening pulse pressure\n- Bradycardia\n- Irregular respirations (e.g., Cheyne-Stokes, ataxic)\n\nIncorrect Options:\n(B) & (D): Narrow pulse pressure occurs in shock, not increased ICP.\n(C) Kussmaul breathing is linked to metabolic acidosis, not head injury.\n\nEarly Signs of ↑ ICP:\n- Altered LOC\n- Headache, pupillary changes\n\nLate Signs:\n- Cushing’s Triad\n- Posturing, fixed/dilated pupils\n\nManagement:\n- Elevate HOB, neutral neck position\n- Administer mannitol/hypertonic saline\n- Avoid straining (e.g., coughing)\n\nTextbook Reference: Brunner & Suddarth, 14th Ed., Chapter 61"

    "question": "Which of the following respiratory patterns indicate increased intracranial pressure in the brain stem?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Slow, irregular respirations",
      "B": "Rapid, shallow respirations",
      "C": "Asymmetric chest excursion",
      "D": "Nasal flaring"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Slow, irregular respirations are a sign of brainstem dysfunction due to increased intracranial pressure. These irregular patterns result from damage to the medullary respiratory centers.",
    "additional": "Examples of abnormal patterns:\n- Cheyne-Stokes: Cyclical breathing with apnea\n- Ataxic/Biot’s: Irregular rhythm, unpredictable pauses\n\nIncorrect Options:\n(B) Rapid breathing = anxiety, fever\n(C) Asymmetric chest = local lung issue\n(D) Nasal flaring = respiratory distress (e.g., asthma), not ICP\n\nRelated to Cushing’s Triad: Respiratory irregularity is a late sign.\n\nOther Key Neurologic Signs:\n- GCS decrease is often first sign of deterioration\n- Pupillary changes (sluggish → fixed)\n\nTextbook Reference: Brunner & Suddarth, 14th Ed., Chapter 61"

    "question": "A client has signs of increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Which of the following is an early indicator of deterioration in the client’s condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Widening pulse pressure",
      "B": "Decrease in pulse rate",
      "C": "Dilated fixed pupils",
      "D": "Decrease in level of consciousness"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The single most important and earliest sign of increasing ICP is a change in the patient's Level of Consciousness (LOC). The cerebral cortex is highly sensitive to changes in pressure and oxygenation. Even subtle changes, such as increased restlessness, new or worsening confusion, disorientation, or increased lethargy, are the first clues that neurologic status is deteriorating.",
    "additional": "Widening pulse pressure and bradycardia (decreased pulse rate) are part of Cushing's Triad—a late sign of brainstem compression. Dilated fixed pupils indicate late-stage brainstem damage. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is used to track LOC changes. Early to late signs follow a hierarchy: first LOC change, then pupillary/motor issues, followed by Cushing's Triad and posturing. Reference: Brunner & Suddarth, 14th Ed., Ch. 61, Table 61-2."

    "question": "Cardiac output is equal to:",
    "options": {
      "A": "Heart rate × patient's body weight",
      "B": "Venous return × Peripheral resistance",
      "C": "Peripheral resistance × stroke volume",
      "D": "Stroke volume × heart rate"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This is the fundamental definition of cardiac output (CO). CO is the total volume of blood pumped by the ventricle per minute, typically 4–8 L/min. Stroke Volume (SV) is the amount of blood ejected per beat (~70 mL), and Heart Rate (HR) is the number of beats per minute. CO = SV × HR. For instance, SV = 70 mL and HR = 70 bpm gives CO = 4900 mL/min or 4.9 L/min.",
    "additional": "Body weight is used in calculating Cardiac Index, not CO. Peripheral resistance is part of BP formula (BP = CO × SVR). NCK may ask about stroke volume components: Preload (volume/stretch), Afterload (resistance), and Contractility (force). Conditions like heart failure, hypovolemia, and hypertension alter these components. Reference: Brunner & Suddarth, 14th Ed., Ch. 25."

      "A": "Tapping, Swishing, Knocking, muffling and silence",
      "B": "Swishing, Tapping, Silence, muffling and knocking",
      "C": "Knocking, Tapping, Swishing, muffling, silence",
      "D": "Silence, Tapping, Knocking, Swishing and Muffling"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Korotkoff sounds are classified into five phases: Phase I (Tapping) is the systolic pressure; Phase II (Swishing) is softer as flow resumes; Phase III (Knocking) is louder and clearer; Phase IV (Muffling) indicates near-diastolic pressure; and Phase V (Silence) marks diastolic pressure.",
    "additional": "Incorrect sequences confuse the standardized phases. Be aware of the auscultatory gap, a silence between Phase II and III in hypertensive patients. Proper BP technique includes correct cuff size, resting 5 minutes prior, arm at heart level, and slow deflation (2–3 mmHg/s). NCK might test order of sounds or ask for technique flaws.
