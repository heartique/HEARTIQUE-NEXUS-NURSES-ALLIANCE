It focuses on the distance of the placental edge from the internal os.\n\nLow-lying placenta: The placental edge is within 2 cm of the internal os, but not covering it.\nPlacenta previa: The placenta covers the internal os (this term now encompasses the old Type 3 and Type 4).\n\nClinical Significance of Complete (Type 4) Previa: It is an absolute contraindication for vaginal delivery. Attempting a vaginal birth would lead to catastrophic hemorrhage as the cervix dilates and effaces, tearing the overlying placenta.

    "explanation": "Severe anaemia can lead to a condition called high-output cardiac failure. The heart is forced to work much harder to pump the oxygen-poor blood around the body to meet metabolic demands. Over time, this chronic strain can cause the heart to fail, mimicking or causing a cardiac disease state. Therefore, severe anaemia is a predisposing factor for cardiac decompensation.",

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Why (d) is the best answer: The primary therapeutic goal of increasing fluid intake in any UTI is to increase urine output. This creates a \"flushing\" mechanism, helping to mechanically wash bacteria out of the urinary tract (from the kidneys down to the bladder and urethra). A high, steady flow of urine prevents stasis and makes it harder for bacteria to adhere to the urothelium and ascend.\n\nWhy (b) is also correct but less specific: Patients with acute pyelonephritis are often systemically unwell with high fever and vomiting, which leads to dehydration. Correcting this dehydration is a critical part of management and is achieved through high fluid intake (often IV initially). However, the reason why this is particularly important for the UTI itself is to facilitate increased urine output. Therefore, (d) is the more specific physiological reason related to treating the infection.",

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Why B is correct: During pregnancy, a diabetic mother has high blood glucose levels (hyperglycemia). This glucose freely crosses the placenta to the fetus. In response, the fetal pancreas produces high levels of insulin (fetal hyperinsulinemia) to manage this high glucose load. After birth, the maternal glucose supply is abruptly cut off, but the newborn's pancreas continues to produce high levels of insulin for a period.

    "explanation": "Why A is correct: This scenario describes a major postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), which is a life-threatening emergency. One person cannot manage it alone. The absolute first action is to call for help (or press the emergency buzzer). This mobilizes the team—other midwives, doctors, anesthetists—who can bring equipment, drugs, and start parallel tasks (like securing IV access, drawing blood, preparing for theatre).

  "answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Why C is correct: The question provides the three hallmark signs of placenta previa: 1. Sudden onset, 2. Painless, and 3. Bright red vaginal bleeding. This occurs because the placenta is implanted in the lower uterine segment, over or near the cervical os. As the lower segment begins to efface and dilate slightly in late pregnancy, the placental attachments can shear, causing bleeding from the maternal vessels. The blood is fresh, hence \"bright red,\" and because it doesn't irritate the uterine muscle, it is painless.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n\nA) Abruptio Placentae: This is the premature separation of a normally implanted placenta. It classically presents with painful vaginal bleeding (due to uterine irritation from blood), a tense/rigid uterus, and the blood is often dark red.\n\nB) An ectopic pregnancy: This typically presents with bleeding and pain in the first trimester, not at 30 weeks.\n\nD) Twin pregnancy: While it is a risk factor for APH, it is not a direct cause.

  "answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Why B is correct: In the fetus, the lungs are filled with fluid and are not used for gas exchange. Therefore, the circulatory system has shunts to bypass them. The ductus arteriosus is a blood vessel connecting the pulmonary artery directly to the descending aorta. This allows the majority of blood from the right ventricle to bypass the high-resistance pulmonary circulation and enter the systemic circulation.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n\nA) Ductus venosus: This shunt bypasses the liver. It connects the umbilical vein to the inferior vena cava.\n\nC) Foramen ovale: This is an opening between the right and left atria. It shunts blood from the right atrium to the left atrium, also helping to bypass the lungs. While it is a lung bypass, the structure that shunts blood around the lungs (from the pulmonary artery) is the ductus arteriosus.

Closes at birth and becomes the Ligamentum Arteriosum.\n\nDuctus Venosus: Shunts oxygenated blood from Umbilical Vein -> Inferior Vena Cava (bypassing the liver). Closes at birth and becomes the Ligamentum Venosum.\n\nTrigger for Closure: The first breath dramatically decreases pulmonary vascular resistance, causing pressure in the right side of the heart to drop and pressure in the left side to rise. This change in pressure gradients functionally closes the foramen ovale.

While highly indicative of pregnancy, other conditions (like certain tumors) can also produce hCG.\n\nHegar's sign (softening of the lower uterine segment) is also a probable sign, as it is an objective change felt by the examiner during a physical assessment.\n\nTherefore, the items in option C fall under the category of probable signs, not presumptive.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n\nA) Amenorrhea (missed period) and morning sickness (nausea) are classic presumptive signs.\n\nB) Breast changes (tenderness, enlargement) and skin changes (linea nigra, chloasma) are also presumptive signs.\n\nD) Bladder irritability (frequent urination) and quickening (fetal movement felt by mother) are presumptive signs.",
  "additional": "Key Concept: This is a foundational knowledge question. You must be able to clearly categorize the signs of pregnancy.\n\nPresumptive (Subjective): Changes the woman feels. (Amenorrhea, N/V, fatigue, quickening).\n\nProbable (Objective): Changes the examiner observes. (Positive pregnancy test, Hegar's sign, Goodell's sign, Chadwick's sign, uterine enlargement, ballottement).\n\nPositive (Diagnostic): Absolute proof. (Fetal heart tones heard, fetus visualized on ultrasound, fetal movement felt by examiner).\n\nClinical Application: Understanding these categories helps in counseling a woman. If she only has presumptive signs, you advise her that these could be due to other causes and a test is needed. If she has probable signs, pregnancy is very likely, but positive signs are needed for 100% confirmation.\n\nPossible NCK Question: \"A midwife visualizes the fetal outline on an ultrasound screen. This is classified as what type of sign of pregnancy?\" Answer: A positive sign.\n\nRecommended Reading:\n\nMaternity and Women's Health Care by Lowdermilk et al. - Review the summary table of presumptive, probable, and positive signs of pregnancy."

    "B": "Disordered uterine action, cervical dystocia with oedema of the vulva",
    "C": "Obstructed labor, uterine inertia and hypertonic uterine action",
    "D": "Hypotonic Uterine action, cord prolapse and postpartum hemorrhage"
  },
  "answer": "D",
  "explanation": "Why D is correct: Polyhydramnios is the presence of excessive amniotic fluid. This overstretches the uterine muscle fibers.\n\nHypotonic Uterine Action: Overstretched muscle fibers cannot contract effectively, leading to weak, infrequent, and uncoordinated contractions (hypotonic uterine inertia). This can cause slow or arrested labor progress.\n\nCord Prolapse: When the membranes rupture, the large gush of fluid can easily wash the umbilical cord down ahead of the presenting part, causing a cord prolapse—a major obstetric emergency.\n\nPostpartum Hemorrhage (PPH): After delivery, the overstretched uterus has difficulty contracting down firmly (uterine atony), which is the leading cause of PPH.\n\nThis option perfectly lists the key labor-related complications of polyhydramnios.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n\nA) \"Indigestion\" is not a direct effect on labor. Prematurity is a risk, but the description of labor is incomplete.\n\nB) Cervical dystocia and vulval edema are not the primary, classic complications.\n\nC) \"Hypertonic\" uterine action (excessively strong, frequent contractions) is the opposite of what is typically seen. Obstructed labor is also less likely than a dysfunctional, hypotonic labor.",
  "additional": "Key Concept: Understand the mechanical and physiological consequences of both polyhydramnios and oligohydramnios.\n\nAssociated Conditions: Polyhydramnios is often associated with:\n\nMaternal: Diabetes Mellitus.\n\nFetal: GI tract anomalies (e.g., esophageal atresia, duodenal atresia which prevent the fetus from swallowing fluid), neural tube defects, and multiple pregnancies.\n\nOligohydramnios: The opposite condition (too little fluid). This is associated with:\n\nMaternal: Uteroplacental insufficiency, dehydration.\n\nFetal: Renal agenesis (Potter's syndrome), PROM (premature rupture of membranes), post-term pregnancy.\n\nComplications: Cord compression (leading to variable decelerations), fetal distress, and pulmonary hypoplasia.\n\nPossible NCK Question: \"During an assessment of a laboring client, the midwife notes persistent variable decelerations on the fetal heart rate tracing.

    "B": "Prevent seizures",
    "C": "Improve urine output",
    "D": "Control uterine contraction patterns"
  },
  "answer": "D",
  "explanation": "Why D is correct: When administered for preterm labor, magnesium sulphate acts as a tocolytic. It relaxes smooth muscle, including the uterus, thereby suppressing or \"controlling\" uterine contractions to delay delivery. The primary goal is to buy time (usually 24-48 hours) to administer corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity.\n\nWhy B is a very important, but contextually different, answer: The primary and most well-known use for magnesium sulphate in obstetrics is for seizure prophylaxis and treatment in women with severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia. If the question had mentioned a woman with high blood pressure, option B would be the correct answer. The question specifically states \"premature labor,\" making the tocolytic effect (D) the intended answer.\n\nFetal Neuroprotection: It's also important to note that a secondary, and now very important, reason for giving MgSO4 in imminent preterm birth (<32 weeks) is for fetal neuroprotection, as it has been shown to reduce the risk and severity of cerebral palsy. This is not listed as an option.\n\nWhy A & C are incorrect:\n\nA) It does not enhance fetal maturity directly. Corticosteroids (like Betamethasone) do that.\n\nC) It does not improve urine output. In fact, decreased urine output (<30 ml/hr) is a sign of magnesium toxicity, as the drug is cleared by the kidneys.",
  "additional": "Key Concept: Magnesium Sulphate is a high-alert medication with multiple uses and critical safety monitoring.\n\nMonitoring for Magnesium Toxicity (BURP):\n\nBlood pressure decreases (hypotension).\n\nUrine output decreases (<30 ml/hr).\n\nRespiratory rate decreases (<12 breaths/min).\n\nPatellar reflex is absent (loss of deep tendon reflexes).\n\nAntidote: The antidote for magnesium sulphate toxicity is Calcium Gluconate. It should always be readily available at the bedside when a woman is on a magnesium sulphate infusion.\n\nPossible NCK Question: \"A midwife is caring for a client receiving an IV infusion of magnesium sulphate for severe pre-eclampsia.

    "B": "Altered nutrition",
    "C": "Ineffective thermoregulation",
    "D": "Impaired skin integrity"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Why C is correct: The most immediate physiological challenge for a newborn after birth is maintaining its body temperature. Newborns are at very high risk for heat loss due to their large surface area to body mass ratio, thin layer of subcutaneous fat, and wetness from amniotic fluid. Cold stress can lead to hypoglycemia, respiratory distress, and metabolic acidosis. Therefore, preventing heat loss and maintaining a neutral thermal environment is the highest priority immediately after ensuring a patent airway.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n\nA) High risk of infection: This is a very important diagnosis, but it is not as immediate a threat as heat loss. Infection prevention measures are ongoing.\n\nB) Altered nutrition: The first feed is important (ideally within the first hour), but stabilizing the baby's temperature is a prerequisite for effective feeding. A cold baby will be lethargic and a poor feeder.\n\nD) Impaired skin integrity: While important to assess, it is not the most urgent priority compared to thermoregulation.",
  "additional": "Key Concept: Understanding the principles of newborn transition to extrauterine life.

    "B": "Rhesus negative, Coombs negative",
    "C": "Rhesus positive, Coombs negative",
    "D": "Rhesus positive, Coombs positive"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Why C is correct:\n\nRho(D) immune globulin is given to a Rh-negative mother to prevent her from developing antibodies against Rh-positive blood. This process is called isoimmunization.\n\nThe condition for giving RhoGAM is that the mother must be Rh-negative and the newborn must be Rh-positive. This creates the risk of sensitization if fetal Rh-positive red blood cells entered the mother's circulation during delivery.\n\nThe newborn's Coombs test (Direct Coombs Test) should be negative. A negative Coombs test means that the newborn's red blood cells are not currently coated with the mother's antibodies. This indicates that significant sensitization has not yet occurred during this pregnancy, and therefore, giving RhoGAM now will be effective in preventing future sensitization.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n\nA) & B) If the baby is Rh-negative, there is no risk, and RhoGAM is not needed.\n\nD) Rhesus positive, Coombs positive: A positive Coombs test on the baby means the mother is already sensitized and has passed antibodies to the baby, which are now attached to the baby's RBCs. Giving the mother RhoGAM at this point is too late; the \"horse has already bolted from the barn.\" She is already isoimmunized. (The baby in this case would be at high risk for hemolytic disease of the newborn).",

    "C": "Assess cervical Dilatation and effacement",
    "D": "Examine the cord for pulsation and cover it with a sterile towel"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Why B is correct: Cord prolapse is a critical obstetric emergency where the umbilical cord descends ahead of the presenting part, leading to cord compression and interruption of fetal oxygen supply. The single most important immediate action is to relieve the pressure on the cord to restore blood flow to the fetus. This is done by the midwife or doctor inserting a gloved hand into the vagina and manually lifting the presenting part (usually the fetal head) off the umbilical cord. This position must be maintained until delivery by emergency C-section.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n\nA) Explain the condition to the mother: While communication is important, it is not the immediate, life-saving action. This can be done by another team member while you are intervening. Action precedes explanation in this emergency.\n\nC) Assess cervical Dilatation and effacement: This is irrelevant. The diagnosis of cord prolapse mandates immediate delivery, usually by C-section, regardless of dilatation (unless delivery is truly imminent). Wasting time on this assessment compromises the fetus.\n\nD) Examine the cord for pulsation and cover it with a sterile towel: Assessing for pulsation is part of the initial diagnosis, not the intervention. Covering the cord with a warm, sterile, saline-soaked gauze is a good secondary measure to prevent vasospasm and drying, but relieving the pressure is the absolute priority.",
  "additional": "Key Concept: Management of cord prolapse is about speed and relieving pressure.\n\nEmergency Management Sequence (S.O.S.):\n\nStop the pressure: Call for help immediately. Place the mother in a position that uses gravity to relieve pressure (e.g., knee-chest position or extreme Trendelenburg). The examiner inserts a hand to lift the presenting part off the cord. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO PUSH THE CORD BACK IN.\n\nOxygen: Administer high-flow oxygen (8-10 L/min via face mask) to the mother to maximize fetal oxygenation.\n\nSection: Prepare for immediate emergency Caesarean section.

    "C": "Creatinine levels",
    "D": "Lecithin-sphingomyelin (L:S) ratio"

  "answer": "D",
  "explanation": "Why D is correct: Surfactant is a substance that coats the alveoli in the lungs, preventing them from collapsing on expiration. It is primarily composed of phospholipids. Lecithin and sphingomyelin are two such phospholipids.\n\nEarly in pregnancy, their levels are roughly equal.\n\nAround 34-35 weeks gestation, the production of lecithin surges while sphingomyelin remains constant.\n\nAn L:S ratio of 2:1 or greater indicates that the fetal lungs are mature and the risk of Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) after birth is very low. This is the gold standard test for fetal lung maturity from an amniotic fluid sample.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n\nA) Bilirubin levels: Used to assess for fetal hemolysis (e.g., in Rh isoimmunization). Levels should decrease as the fetus matures.\n\nB) Cytology: The study of cells, used to detect chromosomal abnormalities or infections, not lung maturity.\n\nC) Creatinine levels: Reflects fetal kidney maturity and muscle mass, not lung maturity.",

    "C": "Massage the woman's uterus",
    "D": "Ask the woman to try and open her bowels as soon as possible"
  },
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Why A is correct: Immediately after delivery, the fundus should be firm, midline, and at or slightly below the level of the umbilicus. A fundus that is displaced from the midline (usually to the right) is the classic sign of a full bladder. The full bladder pushes the uterus up and to the side, preventing it from contracting effectively (a condition known as uterine atony). This places the woman at high risk for PPH. Therefore, the first action is to correct the underlying cause by having the woman empty her bladder.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n\nB) Encourage the woman to drink plenty of fluids: This is good general advice for postpartum recovery and lactation, but it does not solve the immediate problem.\n\nC) Massage the woman's uterus: You would massage the uterus after the bladder is empty if it remains boggy. Trying to massage a uterus that is being pushed aside by a full bladder is less effective.

  "explanation": "Why C is correct: Heparin is an anticoagulant. Its primary mechanism of action is to interfere with the clotting cascade, thereby preventing the formation of new clots and preventing existing clots from growing larger. It does not dissolve existing clots. The body's own fibrinolytic system is responsible for slowly breaking down the existing clot over time.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n\nA) Dissolve the thrombus: This is the function of thrombolytic or \"clot-busting\" drugs like Alteplase (tPA). These are used in acute emergencies like stroke or myocardial infarction, not typically for DVT.\n\nB) Decrease the pain: While reducing clot growth may indirectly alleviate some pain over time, heparin is not an analgesic.

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Why C is correct: The McRoberts maneuver is the initial and least invasive intervention for shoulder dystocia. It involves hyperflexing the mother's legs back onto her abdomen. This action flattens the sacral promontory and rotates the symphysis pubis superiorly, which often provides enough space for the anterior shoulder to dislodge from under the pubic bone. It is simple, quick, and can be performed by the midwife and assistants immediately.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n\nA) Apply fundal pressure: This is contraindicated and dangerous. Pushing on the fundus can further impact the anterior shoulder under the pubic bone, increasing the risk of brachial plexus injury (Erb's palsy) or a fractured clavicle. Suprapubic pressure, however, is a valid secondary maneuver.\n\nB) Rubin maneuver: This is an internal maneuver where the midwife attempts to rotate the baby's shoulders.

They indicate cord compression.\n\nC) Late deceleration: These are non-reassuring. They also have a gradual onset, but their nadir occurs after the peak of the contraction, and the FHR does not return to baseline until after the contraction is over. They indicate uteroplacental insufficiency and fetal hypoxia.\n\nD) Prolonged deceleration: This is a decrease in FHR of at least 15 bpm below baseline that lasts for more than 2 minutes but less than 10 minutes.

It follows lochia rubra and represents a normal progression of uterine healing. The decreasing amount is also a normal finding.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n\nA) This describes excessive bleeding (PPH) and would be characteristic of lochia rubra. Soaking a pad per hour is abnormal at any stage after the first few hours.\n\nB) A foul odor and uterine tenderness are classic signs of endometritis, a postpartum infection.\n\nD) A complete cessation of lochia this early could indicate a problem, such as a cervical obstruction trapping the discharge, which could also lead to infection. The process should be gradual.",
    "additional": "Key Concept: The three stages of lochia.\n\nLochia Rubra: Bright red, mostly blood. Lasts for the first 3-4 days.\n\nLochia Serosa: Pinkish-brown, contains serosanguinous fluid, leukocytes, and decidual tissue. Lasts from day 4 to day 10.\n\nLochia Alba: Whitish-yellow, contains mostly leukocytes and mucus.

    "question": "During a vaginal examination of a woman in labor, the midwife palpates a soft, irregular mass with no discernible sutures or fontanelles. The midwife also notes the passage of meconium, although the fetal heart rate is stable and reassuring. These findings are most consistent with which fetal presentation?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Vertex presentation",
      "B": "Face presentation",
      "C": "Breech presentation",
      "D": "Shoulder presentation"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Why C is correct: A breech presentation means the fetal buttocks or feet are the presenting part. On vaginal examination, the buttocks feel like a \"soft, irregular mass.\" The anal sphincter can be mistaken for a mouth, but there are no bony jaws. The passage of meconium is common in breech presentations due to compression of the fetal abdomen during contractions and is not necessarily a sign of fetal distress in this context.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n\nA) Vertex presentation: The midwife would feel the hard, round occiput with identifiable sutures and fontanelles.\n\nB) Face presentation: The midwife would feel distinct facial features: the orbital ridges, nose, and mouth with hard alveolar ridges (gums).\n\nD) Shoulder presentation (transverse lie): The midwife would often feel the acromion process of the shoulder, the ribs (a \"grill-like\" sensation), or an empty pelvis if the fetus is high. A vaginal delivery is not possible with a persistent shoulder presentation.",
    "additional": "Key Concept: Differentiating fetal presentations via vaginal examination is a core midwifery skill.\n\nTypes of Breech:\n\nFrank Breech: Hips flexed, knees extended (most common).\n\nComplete Breech: Hips and knees flexed (sitting cross-legged).\n\nFootling Breech: One or both feet present first. This carries the highest risk of cord prolapse.\n\nManagement: Management depends on many factors, including type of breech, fetal size, and provider skill. Options include External Cephalic Version (ECV) near term to turn the baby, planned Caesarean section, or a trial of vaginal breech delivery in carefully selected cases.\n\nPossible NCK Question: \"A woman is confirmed to have a footling breech presentation at 39 weeks.

    "question": "A newborn is exhibiting signs of jitteriness, a high-pitched cry, and poor feeding. The mother has a history of substance use during pregnancy. The midwife suspects Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS). Which of the following would be an appropriate nursing intervention for this newborn?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Place the newborn in a brightly lit, active area of the nursery to provide stimulation.",
      "B": "Encourage frequent handling and interaction from various staff members.",
      "C": "Swaddle the newborn snugly and place them in a quiet, low-lit environment.",
      "D": "Schedule feedings every 5-6 hours to allow for longer periods of rest."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Why C is correct: Newborns with NAS are hypersensitive to stimuli. Their central nervous systems are over-excited. The goal of nursing care is to minimize environmental stimuli. Swaddling provides comfort and security, reduces tremors, and promotes a sense of calm. A quiet, dark environment helps to decrease the sensory overload that can worsen their symptoms.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n\nA) Bright lights and activity would severely overstimulate the newborn, increasing agitation and crying.\n\nB) Frequent handling by multiple people is also overstimulating. Care should be clustered and provided by a consistent, primary caregiver when possible.\n\nD) These infants often have poor feeding and high metabolic rates. They need small, frequent feedings (e.g., every 2-3 hours) to meet their nutritional needs and prevent dehydration and hypoglycemia. Longer intervals would be detrimental.",
    "additional": "Key Concept: Non-pharmacological supportive care is the cornerstone of managing NAS.\n\nSigns of NAS (WITHDRAWAL mnemonic):\n\nWakefulness\n\nIrritability, High-pitched cry\n\nTemperature instability, Tremors\n\nHyperactivity, Hypertonia\n\nDiarrhea, Diaphoresis (sweating)\n\nRespiratory distress, Rub marks (from hyperactivity)\n\nApneic attacks\n\nWeight loss or failure to gain weight\n\nAlkalosis (respiratory)\n\nLacrimation (tearing), yawning, sneezing\n\nNursing Care Priorities:\n\nMinimize stimuli.\n\nProvide comfort (swaddling, non-nutritive sucking).\n\nMeet nutritional needs with small, frequent, high-calorie feeds.\n\nMonitor for skin breakdown.\n\nPromote parent-infant bonding.\n\nPharmacological treatment (e.g., morphine, methadone) may be required based on withdrawal scores (e.g., Finnegan score).\n\nPossible NCK Question: \"When feeding a newborn with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome, what is the best approach?\" Answer: Offer small, high-calorie feedings on a frequent schedule.\n\nRecommended Reading:\n\nWong's Nursing Care of Infants and Children - Chapter on the High-Risk Newborn, specifically the section on infants of substance-using mothers."

  "question": "A pregnant woman at 12 weeks gestation is found to be non-immune to Rubella (German Measles) based on her antenatal screening results. What is the most appropriate advice the midwife should provide?",
  "options": {
    "A": "You should receive the MMR vaccine immediately to protect your baby.",
    "B": "You need to avoid all public places until the baby is born.",
    "C": "We will give you the MMR vaccine in the hospital right after you deliver the baby.",
    "D": "The Rubella vaccine is not necessary as long as you feel healthy."
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Why C is correct: The Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine. Live vaccines are contraindicated during pregnancy due to a theoretical risk of the virus crossing the placenta and harming the fetus. Therefore, the safest and most appropriate time to immunize a non-immune mother is during the immediate postpartum period. This protects her from future pregnancies. It is safe to breastfeed after receiving the MMR vaccine.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n\nA) This is incorrect and unsafe for the reason stated above. The vaccine is contraindicated during pregnancy.\n\nB) While she should be counseled to avoid contact with anyone known to have Rubella, advising complete isolation from all public places is impractical and not the primary management strategy. The key is future prevention through vaccination.\n\nD) This is dangerous advice. Congenital Rubella Syndrome can cause severe birth defects (e.g., deafness, cataracts, heart defects, intellectual disability), so vaccination for a non-immune woman is crucial for the health of future children.",
  "additional": "Key Concept: Understanding which vaccines are safe and which are contraindicated in pregnancy.\n\nSAFE Vaccines (Inactivated/Toxoid):\n\nTetanus, Diphtheria, and acellular Pertussis (Tdap): Recommended for every pregnancy (ideally between 27–36 weeks) to provide passive immunity to the newborn against whooping cough.\n\nInactivated Influenza Vaccine: Recommended for all pregnant women during flu season.\n\nHepatitis B, Rabies (if indicated).\n\nCONTRAINDICATED Vaccines (Live):\n\nMMR (Measles, Mumps, Rubella)\nVaricella (Chickenpox)\nLive Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (nasal spray)\n\nTORCH Infections: This is an acronym for infections that can cause congenital anomalies:\n\nToxoplasmosis\nOther (Syphilis, Varicella, Parvovirus B19)\nRubella\nCytomegalovirus (CMV)\nHerpes Simplex Virus (HSV)\n\nPossible NCK Question: \"A midwife is advising a pregnant client at 28 weeks gestation about recommended immunizations.

    "A": "Combined Oral Contraceptive Pill (COCP)",
    "B": "Progestin-Only Pill (POP)",
    "C": "Copper Intrauterine Device (IUD)",
    "D": "Contraceptive Patch"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Why C is correct: The copper IUD is a non-hormonal method of contraception. It is highly effective and has no systemic hormonal side effects. Given the client's history of DVT, any method containing estrogen is absolutely contraindicated. The copper IUD is a safe and excellent choice for this client. It can be inserted during the postpartum period and does not affect breastfeeding.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n\nA) & D) The Combined Oral Contraceptive Pill and the Contraceptive Patch both contain estrogen, which increases the risk of thromboembolic events like DVT. They are contraindicated in women with a personal history of DVT.\n\nB) Progestin-Only Pill (POP): While the POP does not contain estrogen and is generally considered safe for women with a history of DVT and for breastfeeding mothers, the Copper IUD is often considered more suitable in this specific scenario because it is a long-acting, reversible contraceptive (LARC) with higher typical-use efficacy and removes any potential (though small) hormonal influence. Between B and C, C is the superior option offering long-term, non-hormonal, highly effective coverage.",
  "additional": "Key Concept: Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC) for Contraceptive Use. You must know the absolute and relative contraindications for common methods.\n\nAbsolute Contraindications for Combined Hormonal Contraceptives (Estrogen-containing):\n\n- History of DVT, PE, stroke, or ischemic heart disease.\n- Uncontrolled hypertension.\n- Migraine with aura.\n- Current breast cancer.\n- Active liver disease.\n- Smoker over age 35 (>15 cigarettes/day).\n- Less than 6 weeks postpartum if breastfeeding (due to VTE risk and potential effect on milk supply).\n\nLactational Amenorrhea Method (LAM): This is a temporary, natural method of contraception for postpartum mothers.

    "C": "Severe Abruptio Placentae",
    "D": "Pre-term Labor"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Why C is correct: This is a classic presentation of a severe placental abruption. The key features are:\n\n- Intense abdominal pain and a tense, board-like, rigid uterus (due to blood accumulating behind the placenta, irritating the myometrium).\n- Vaginal bleeding (which can be dark red or concealed).\n- Signs of maternal shock (hypotension, tachycardia) due to blood loss.\n- Signs of severe fetal distress (bradycardia) due to hypoxia.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n\nA) Placenta Previa: Presents with painless, bright red bleeding, and the uterus is usually soft and non-tender.\n\nB) Uterine Rupture: While it presents with severe pain and fetal distress, the classic sign is often a cessation of contractions and a loss of fetal station, as the fetus moves into the abdominal cavity. The uterus might be difficult to palpate. It's a key differential, but the \"board-like\" uterus strongly points to abruption.\n\nD) Pre-term Labor: Presents with regular, rhythmic contractions and typically does not involve a rigid uterus, signs of shock, or such severe fetal bradycardia.",
  "additional": "Key Concept: Recognizing the signs of an acute obstetric catastrophe.\n\nRisk Factors for Abruptio Placentae:\n- Hypertension/Pre-eclampsia (most common cause)\n- Cocaine use/Smoking\n- Abdominal trauma (e.g., motor vehicle accident)\n- Previous history of abruption\n- Multiple gestation\n\nManagement: This is a life-threatening emergency for both mother and fetus.\n\n- Immediate call for help and activation of the emergency team.\n- Maternal resuscitation: Secure two large-bore IVs, administer crystalloids/blood products, monitor vital signs.\n- Continuous fetal monitoring.\n- Immediate delivery, almost always by emergency Caesarean section.\n\nPossible NCK Question: \"A pregnant woman who used cocaine just before admission presents with a rigid abdomen and dark red vaginal bleeding.

    "A": "Precipitous labor",
    "B": "Arrest of descent",
    "C": "Primary uterine inertia",
    "D": "Secondary arrest of dilatation"
  },
  "answer": "D",
  "explanation": "Why D is correct: This scenario describes a labor that was progressing normally (she entered the active phase) but then stopped.\n\nSecondary arrest of dilatation is defined as no change in cervical dilatation for 2–4 hours during the active phase of labor, after it had previously been progressing. The fact that her contractions have also become weaker points to hypotonic uterine dysfunction (secondary uterine inertia).\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n\nA) Precipitous labor: This is a very rapid labor that lasts less than 3 hours from onset to delivery. This is the opposite of the situation described.\n\nB) Arrest of descent: This refers to a lack of fetal descent for at least one hour in the second stage of labor. The woman is still in the first stage.\n\nC) Primary uterine inertia: This refers to a labor that fails to progress from the very beginning (latent phase). The contractions are weak and inefficient from the onset, and the woman fails to enter a good active labor pattern. This woman was in active labor, but it has now stalled.",

    "C": "Subgaleal hemorrhage",
    "D": "Craniosynostosis"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Why B is correct: Caput succedaneum is a diffuse, edematous swelling of the soft tissues of the scalp. It is caused by pressure from the cervix on the fetal head during labor. The key identifying feature is that it crosses the suture lines. It is present at birth and usually resolves within a few days. It is a benign condition.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n\nA) Cephalohematoma: This is a collection of blood underneath the periosteum of one of the cranial bones. Because it is trapped by the periosteum, it does not cross suture lines. It may not be present at birth but can appear hours later and takes weeks or months to resolve. It puts the infant at a higher risk for jaundice.\n\nC) Subgaleal hemorrhage: This is a rare but life-threatening bleed into the potential space between the scalp aponeurosis and the periosteum. It is a diffuse, boggy swelling that can shift with gravity and can lead to massive blood loss and hypovolemic shock. It is often associated with difficult instrumental deliveries.\n\nD) Craniosynostosis: This is a congenital condition involving the premature fusion of one or more cranial sutures, leading to an abnormal head shape. It is a bony defect, not a soft tissue swelling.",

    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Why C is correct: Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) is a severe and persistent form of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy that goes beyond 'morning sickness.' The incessant vomiting leads to fluid and electrolyte imbalance, significant weight loss (typically >5% of pre-pregnancy weight), and ketonuria. Ketonuria results from the body breaking down fat for energy due to starvation. HG requires careful management and sometimes hospitalization.",

  "explanation": "Why C is correct: The Tonic Neck Reflex, also known as the \"fencing posture,\" is an involuntary reflex observed in young infants. When the infant's head is turned to one side, the arm on that side straightens while the opposite arm bends, as if the infant is in a fencing stance. This reflex typically disappears by 5 to 7 months of age.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n\nA) Moro reflex (startle reflex): Occurs in response to a sudden loss of support or a loud noise. The infant will throw its arms and legs out, then pull them back in.\n\nB) Babinski reflex: Elicited by stroking the sole of the foot. A positive (normal) response in an infant is the fanning out of the toes and dorsiflexion of the big toe.\n\nD) Palmar grasp reflex: Occurs when an object is placed in the infant's palm, causing the infant to grasp it tightly.",
  "additional": "Key Concept: Assessing newborn reflexes is a crucial part of the neurological examination.

  },
  "answer": "D",
  "explanation": "Why D is correct: Human Placental Lactogen (hPL), also known as human chorionic somatomammotropin (hCS), is a key hormone of pregnancy. Its primary role is to act as an insulin antagonist. It decreases maternal glucose uptake and promotes insulin resistance. This ensures that a continuous supply of glucose is available to be transported across the placenta to the fetus, which uses glucose as its primary fuel source. This diabetogenic effect is also what can lead to Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) in susceptible women.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n\nA) hCG: This is the \"hormone of pregnancy\" detected in pregnancy tests. Its main role is to maintain the corpus luteum in early pregnancy so it continues to produce progesterone.\n\nB) Progesterone: This hormone relaxes smooth muscle (preventing uterine contractions) and helps maintain the endometrium. It does not directly cause insulin resistance.\n\nC) Estrogen: Promotes the growth of the uterus, breasts, and external genitalia. It also plays a role in preparing the body for labor.",
  "additional": "Key Concept: Understanding the specific roles of the major pregnancy hormones.\n\nSummary of Placental Hormones:\nhCG: \"Rescues\" the corpus luteum. The basis for pregnancy tests.\nhPL: Creates insulin resistance. Ensures fetal glucose supply. Promotes maternal fat breakdown for energy.\nProgesterone: The \"pro-gestation\" hormone.

  "question": "A woman in active labor receives an epidural anesthetic. Immediately after administration, her blood pressure drops from 120/80 mmHg to 90/50 mmHg. What is the midwife's priority nursing action?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Administer a bolus of an IV vasopressor like ephedrine.",
    "B": "Increase the rate of the maintenance intravenous fluids.",
    "C": "Place the woman in a left lateral tilt position.",
    "D": "Administer oxygen via a non-rebreather mask."
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Why C is correct: The most common side effect of an epidural is maternal hypotension. This is caused by the sympathetic nerve blockade, which leads to vasodilation below the level of the epidural. This vasodilation can cause blood to pool in the lower extremities, reducing venous return to the heart. Placing the woman in a left lateral tilt (or displacing the uterus to the left) is the immediate priority. This moves the heavy, gravid uterus off the inferior vena cava, which maximizes venous return to the heart and can immediately help correct the hypotension.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n\nA) Administer ephedrine: This is a correct intervention, but it is typically a secondary step after positioning and fluid administration have been initiated. The midwife would usually need a physician's order for this medication.\n\nB) Increase the rate of IV fluids: This is also a correct and important intervention. A fluid bolus is often given before the epidural to prevent hypotension, and another bolus is given to treat it. However, the mechanical fix of repositioning is the fastest and most immediate action.\n\nD) Administer oxygen: This is indicated if there are signs of fetal distress resulting from the maternal hypotension, but correcting the cause of the hypotension (the reduced venous return) is the priority.",
  "additional": "Key Concept: Preventing and managing epidural-induced hypotension.\n\nNursing Care for Epidural Placement:\nBefore: Ensure informed consent. Administer an IV fluid bolus (e.g., 500-1000 mL crystalloid). Assess vital signs and FHR baseline. Have the woman empty her bladder.\nDuring: Assist the woman to maintain the correct position (sitting or side-lying).\nAfter: Monitor BP every 2-5 minutes initially. Assess for effectiveness and sensory/motor block level. Continuously monitor FHR. Assist with position changes every 30-60 minutes to ensure even distribution. Monitor for bladder distention (may need catheterization).\n\nPossible NCK Question: \"To minimize the risk of hypotension following the placement of an epidural, what intervention should the midwife perform beforehand?\" Answer: Administer a 500-1000 mL IV fluid bolus.\n\nRecommended Reading:\nMaternity and Women's Health Care by Lowdermilk et al. - Chapter on Pain Management During Labor."

  "question": "A woman at 8 weeks gestation presents with right-sided abdominal pain and dark red vaginal spotting. Her last menstrual period was 8 weeks ago. On examination, her abdomen is tender, and she feels dizzy. These findings are highly suspicious of:",
  "options": {
    "A": "Inevitable abortion",
    "B": "Hydatidiform mole",
    "C": "Ruptured ectopic pregnancy",
    "D": "Threatened abortion"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Why C is correct: The classic triad of symptoms for an ectopic pregnancy is 1. Abdominal pain (often unilateral), 2. Amenorrhea, and 3. Vaginal spotting. The signs of a rupture are the progression to severe pain, and signs of internal bleeding and shock, such as dizziness, shoulder tip pain (referred pain from diaphragmatic irritation), and tenderness. This is a life-threatening surgical emergency.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n\nA) Inevitable abortion: Presents with bleeding, lower midline cramping, and an open cervical os. The pain is typically central, not unilateral.\n\nB) Hydatidiform mole: Often presents with a uterus larger than dates, severe nausea/vomiting, and passage of \"grape-like\" vesicles. While bleeding occurs, sharp unilateral pain and signs of shock are not typical unless there is a rare complication.\n\nD) Threatened abortion: Presents with vaginal bleeding, but the cervix is closed, and the pain, if present, is usually mild and central. The pregnancy may still be viable.",
  "additional": "Key Concept: Any woman of childbearing age presenting with abdominal pain should be considered to have an ectopic pregnancy until proven otherwise.\n\nRisk Factors for Ectopic Pregnancy:\n- History of Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID)\n- Previous ectopic pregnancy\n- History of tubal surgery\n- Use of an Intrauterine Device (IUD)\n- Infertility treatments (IVF)\n\nManagement:\nUnruptured/Stable: Can sometimes be managed medically with Methotrexate, which destroys the rapidly dividing trophoblastic cells.\n\nRuptured/Unstable: This is a surgical emergency requiring immediate laparoscopy or laparotomy to remove the ectopic pregnancy and control the bleeding (salpingectomy or salpingostomy).\n\nPossible NCK Question: \"A client is being treated with methotrexate for an unruptured ectopic pregnancy. What is the most important piece of health education the midwife should provide?\" Answer: To avoid alcohol and folic acid supplements, as they can interfere with the drug's effectiveness.\n\nRecommended Reading:\nMyles Textbook for Midwives - Chapter on bleeding in early pregnancy."

      "B": "Couch the patient on breathing and relaxing techniques",
      "C": "Administer an analgesic",
      "D": "Ask Miss Katana to move immediately about the room to reduce pain"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Restlessness and irritability from pain are common in active labor. The most appropriate nursing action is to provide non-pharmacological comfort and support. Coaching her in breathing and relaxation techniques helps her cope with the contractions, promotes a sense of control, and conserves energy. Contacting the obstetrician is not an emergency, and administering analgesics or ambulation are secondary options after providing basic support.",

    "options": {
      "A": "Cervix is 4cm wide and 60% shorter than the normal",
      "B": "Cervix is 4cm short and 60% thinner than normal",
      "C": "Walls of the cervix are 4cm thick and 60% shorter than normal",
      "D": "Cervix is 4cm long and 60% wider than normal"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Dilation refers to the widening of the cervical os, measured in centimeters. Effacement refers to the thinning and shortening of the cervix, measured as a percentage. Therefore, a cervix that is 4cm dilated and 60% effaced is 4cm wide and has shortened by 60% from its original length. Option A is the most accurate clinical interpretation.",
    "additional": "NCK Tip: Understand how to interpret findings in a vaginal exam. Effacement is shortening/thinning of the cervix; dilation is opening. This helps identify labor progress."

      "A": "Autolysis",
      "B": "Lochia loss",
      "C": "Hormonal influence",
      "D": "Postpartum exercises"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Involution is the process by which the uterus returns to its pre-pregnant state. The primary mechanism is autolysis, which is the self-digestion of uterine muscle cells (myometrium) by their own proteolytic enzymes. This process reduces the size of each individual cell, dramatically shrinking the uterus. Hormonal changes (the drop in estrogen and progesterone) trigger this process, but autolysis is the main factor that accomplishes it.",
    "additional": "NCK Emphasis: Uterine involution is a common question area. Know the physiological process, timeframe (around 6 weeks), and what normal vs abnormal involution looks like."

      "D": "At the midpoint of the fourchette and is directed at an angle of 45°"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The most common type of episiotomy performed is the mediolateral episiotomy. It begins at the midpoint of the fourchette (posterior commissure) and is directed downwards and outwards at approximately a 45-degree angle. This technique avoids the anal sphincter (reducing the risk of 3rd and 4th-degree tears) while still providing adequate room. A midline (median) episiotomy goes straight down but carries a higher risk of sphincter injury.",
    "additional": "NCK Focus: Always distinguish between median and mediolateral episiotomies — including their anatomical direction and complications (especially anal sphincter injury)."

    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The BCG vaccine protects against severe forms of tuberculosis (TB) in children. According to WHO and most national guidelines (including Kenya's KEPI schedule), it should be given to all eligible newborns as soon as possible after birth, ideally before they leave the health facility. This provides the earliest possible protection.",

      "C": "Incompetent cervix",
      "D": "Iron deficiency anemia"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Pregnant adolescents are at high risk for iron deficiency anemia. This is due to a combination of their own growth spurt demands for iron, poor dietary habits common in this age group, and the high iron requirements of pregnancy itself. They are also at higher risk for pre-eclampsia, preterm labor, and low birth weight infants.",
    "additional": "NCK Tip: Adolescent pregnancy is a vulnerable group. Questions often test nutritional needs, risk factors (like anemia, PIH), and need for psychosocial support."

      "C": "Apply on the identification band",
      "D": "Check the number of umbilical vessels"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The absolute priority in the first moments after delivery (after ensuring a clear airway) is to prevent heat loss. The greatest source of heat loss is evaporation from the wet amniotic fluid. Therefore, drying the baby thoroughly is the most critical immediate action to prevent hypothermia and cold stress. All other tasks (weighing, ID bands) can be done after the baby is warm and stable.",
    "additional": "NCK Focus: Thermal protection is a newborn priority. Remember the 3 major priorities: Dry (warmth), Clear airway (suction), and Stimulate breathing."

      "D": "A woman who says she has been in labor for 24 hours"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "A prolapsed umbilical cord is a critical obstetric emergency where the cord descends ahead of the baby, leading to compression and immediate cessation of fetal oxygen supply. The only definitive management is an emergency Caesarean section to deliver the baby as quickly as possible. The other options are not, by themselves, indications for an emergency C-section.",
