The standard recommendation is to start prophylactic therapy with Isoniazid (INH). While the exact dosage can be 5-10 mg/kg, the duration is typically long-term, lasting for 6 months. The infant should also be evaluated to rule out congenital TB before starting prophylaxis.",
    "additional": "BCG Vaccination: In this scenario, the BCG vaccine is usually deferred until the course of INH prophylaxis is completed. This is because INH can interfere with the replication of the live attenuated bacteria in the BCG vaccine, rendering it ineffective.\n\nBreastfeeding: Breastfeeding is generally encouraged as the risk of transmission through breast milk is minimal, and the benefits are substantial. The mother should be on appropriate anti-tuberculous treatment and advised on hygiene measures (e.g., wearing a mask during feeding) if she is still infectious.\n\nEvaluation of the Infant: Before starting prophylaxis, the infant should have a thorough physical examination, chest X-ray, and sometimes a lumbar puncture or gastric aspirates to rule out established congenital TB.

It focuses on the distance of the placental edge from the internal os.\n\nLow-lying placenta: The placental edge is within 2 cm of the internal os, but not covering it.\nPlacenta previa: The placenta covers the internal os (this term now encompasses the old Type 3 and Type 4).\n\nClinical Significance of Complete (Type 4) Previa: It is an absolute contraindication for vaginal delivery. Attempting a vaginal birth would lead to catastrophic hemorrhage as the cervix dilates and effaces, tearing the overlying placenta. Delivery must be via Caesarean section.\n\nBOOK: Myles Textbook for Midwives"

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Severe anaemia can lead to a condition called high-output cardiac failure. The heart is forced to work much harder to pump the oxygen-poor blood around the body to meet metabolic demands. Over time, this chronic strain can cause the heart to fail, mimicking or causing a cardiac disease state. Therefore, severe anaemia is a predisposing factor for cardiac decompensation.",
    "additional": "a), b), and c) are all signs and symptoms of cardiac decompensation (heart failure). They are the result of the heart disease, not the cause. Pulmonary oedema (fluid in the lungs), easy fatiguability, and basal crepitations (crackles heard on auscultation) are classic indicators of heart failure.\n\nBOOK: Myles Textbook for Midwives"

    "explanation": "Reflux is the abnormal backward flow of urine from the bladder into the ureters. This is a significant pathological factor that allows bacteria from the bladder to easily ascend to the kidneys, causing pyelonephritis.",
    "additional": "Analysis of Options:\n\na) & b) Kinking of the ureters and vesico-ureteric reflux are underlying anatomical or physiological problems that predispose a person to pyelonephritis. They are causes, not symptoms.\n\nc) A 'fishy smell' in vaginal discharge (not typically urine) is characteristic of Bacterial Vaginosis.

    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Why (d) is the best answer: The primary therapeutic goal of increasing fluid intake in any UTI is to increase urine output. This creates a \"flushing\" mechanism, helping to mechanically wash bacteria out of the urinary tract (from the kidneys down to the bladder and urethra). A high, steady flow of urine prevents stasis and makes it harder for bacteria to adhere to the urothelium and ascend.\n\nWhy (b) is also correct but less specific: Patients with acute pyelonephritis are often systemically unwell with high fever and vomiting, which leads to dehydration. Correcting this dehydration is a critical part of management and is achieved through high fluid intake (often IV initially). However, the reason why this is particularly important for the UTI itself is to facilitate increased urine output. Therefore, (d) is the more specific physiological reason related to treating the infection.",

Prolonged and severe renal hypoperfusion causes ischemic injury to the kidney tubules, a condition known as Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN).

      "C": "Results from total loss of polarity and fundal dominance, causing uncoordinated contractions",
      "D": "Results from loss of tone and overstretched uterus"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "A colicky uterus is characterized by chaotic, uncoordinated uterine contractions due to complete loss of polarity and fundal dominance. This leads to ineffective labor with painful, irregular contractions that fail to cause cervical dilatation or descent of the presenting part.",
    "additional": "This pattern may develop from mismanagement with oxytocin or uterine exhaustion. It is often associated with obstructed labor and maternal distress."
  },
  {
    "question": "Constriction ring dystocia during labor is best described by which of the following?",

      "C": "Localized spasms develop at the retraction ring, preventing descent",
      "D": "The uterus stops contracting altogether causing secondary inertia"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Constriction ring dystocia occurs when a localized, spastic contraction develops typically at the junction between the upper and lower uterine segments (the retraction ring). This ring traps the fetus, preventing descent despite adequate contractions.",
    "additional": "Unlike Bandl’s ring (a sign of imminent rupture), constriction rings are not palpable externally. It’s often associated with prolonged labor or inappropriate oxytocin use."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which of the following best describes precipitate labor?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Results from total loss of uterine polarity",
      "B": "Results from localized spasm at the internal os",
      "C": "Results from excessive uterine action leading to very rapid labor",
      "D": "Results from ineffective uterine contractions and prolonged labor"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Precipitate labor is defined as labor that is completed in less than 3 hours from onset. It is usually due to excessive uterine activity and efficient contractions that cause rapid cervical dilatation and fetal expulsion.",
    "additional": "This can be dangerous, increasing risks of perineal trauma, uterine rupture, or fetal injury. It may be seen in grand multiparity or after prostaglandin misuse."
  },
  {
    "question": "Cervical dystocia is best defined as which of the following?",

      "C": "Failure of descent due to malpresentation",
      "D": "Lack of uterine contractions causing labor arrest"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Cervical dystocia occurs when the cervix fails to dilate despite good uterine contractions and proper application of the fetal presenting part. It can be caused by cervical scarring, poor cervical compliance, or functional disorders.",
    "additional": "This condition may require surgical intervention such as cesarean section if persistent. Differentiation from uterine dystocia or obstruction is critical."

      "C": "To relieve irritability",
      "D": "To increase urine output"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The most direct therapeutic reason for high fluid intake in urinary tract infections is to increase urine output, which helps flush out bacteria from the urinary system.",
    "additional": "Although correcting dehydration is a key goal, the primary benefit is mechanical flushing of bacteria through diuresis, reducing the bacterial load."
