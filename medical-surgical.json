      "B": "Immobilizing the affected limb at the level of the heart",
      "C": "Making an incision over the bite site to facilitate venom extraction",
      "D": "Transporting the patient to a medical facility for antivenom administration"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Rapid transport for antivenom is the priority. Antivenom is the only definitive treatment for significant envenomation. \nOther actions like cutting, suctioning, or applying tourniquets can worsen injury and are not recommended."

    "question": "What is the primary purpose of a cervical collar in the management of trauma patients?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Maintaining spinal alignment",
      "B": "Immobilizing the cervical spine",
      "C": "Providing comfort and support",
      "D": "Facilitating airway management"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "A cervical collar prevents neck movement. It restricts motion to prevent further spinal cord injury in trauma patients with suspected neck injury. \nIt must be used with full spinal precautions for effective immobilization."

      "D": "Administering benzodiazepines for sedation"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Opioid overdose leads to respiratory arrest. Immediate support with bag-valve-mask is critical to oxygenate the patient. \nNaloxone should follow but may not act fast enough to prevent hypoxia without ventilation."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the appropriate management for a conscious patient experiencing a seizure?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Restrain the patient to prevent injury",
      "B": "Place the patient in a supine position",
      "C": "Protect the patient from injury, clear the area, and monitor the duration of the seizure",
      "D": "Administer antiepileptic medication immediately"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Do not restrain or force anything into the mouth. Just clear the area, cushion the head, and observe. \nNote the duration and nature of the seizure for further medical management."
  },

      "D": "Encouraging the patient to continue strenuous activity"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Heat cramps are caused by electrolyte and fluid loss. The primary treatment is oral rehydration with electrolyte solutions. \nVigorous massage and continued activity can worsen symptoms or lead to heat exhaustion."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the appropriate initial management for a conscious patient experiencing a syncopal episode (fainting)?",

      "A": "Elevating the legs above the level of the heart",
      "B": "Administering intravenous fluids rapidly",
      "C": "Providing reassurance and assisting the patient to a lying position",
      "D": "Administering oxygen via nasal cannula"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Help the patient lie down safely to restore cerebral perfusion. Reassurance reduces anxiety and supports recovery. \nLeg elevation can follow once the patient is safely lying down, but position and safety come first."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which of the following actions is appropriate for managing a conscious patient with a dislocated shoulder?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Attempting to reduce the dislocation by pulling on the affected arm",

      "C": "Providing analgesia and applying ice packs to the affected shoulder",
      "D": "Administering intravenous fluids to prevent dehydration"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Do not attempt to reduce the shoulder unless trained. The priority is comfort and immobilization. \nApply ice to reduce swelling and provide pain relief while arranging for medical care."

      "D": "Activating emergency medical services (EMS) for rapid transport to a stroke center"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Time is critical in stroke care. Rapid transport to a stroke center enables prompt CT imaging and treatment. \nDo not give aspirin unless hemorrhagic stroke is ruled out. Avoid food or drink due to aspiration risk."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary goal of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in a cardiac arrest situation?",

      "D": "Audible cry, tonic Contractions, lasts for 3 to 4 seconds."
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The aura stage involves early warning signs like visual changes, tingling, or mood shifts, indicating focal brain activity. Jerky movements and tonic contractions describe the actual seizure phase (ictal phase), not the aura."

      "B": "Painful hematuria.",
      "C": "Abdominal mass.",
      "D": "Flank pains."
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Painless hematuria is the most frequent initial symptom of renal cancer and often prompts further investigation. The classic triad also includes flank pain and a mass, but all three together are rare."
