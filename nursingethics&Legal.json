    "question": "When taking care of a rape victim, it is advisable to instruct the patient to shower before going to hospital",
    "options": {
      "A": "True",
      "B": "False"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Why B is correct: This is a critical point in forensic nursing. A survivor of sexual assault should be advised NOT to shower, bathe, douche, change clothes, or even comb their hair before a medical-forensic examination. The reason is to preserve evidence. The examination, often done with a Sexual Assault Evidence Kit (commonly known as a 'rape kit'), involves collecting potential DNA evidence (semen, saliva, skin cells) and other physical evidence (hair, fibers from clothing) from the victim's body and clothes. Showering or cleaning would wash away and destroy this crucial evidence, which is vital for the investigation and potential prosecution of the perpetrator.\n\nWhy A is incorrect: Advising a victim to shower is the opposite of correct procedure and could be seen as obstructing justice, even if unintentional. It undermines the ability to collect forensic evidence.",
    "additional": "Priorities in Caring for a Sexual Assault Survivor:\n\n- Address Immediate Medical Needs: Treat any life-threatening physical injuries first (ABCs).\n- Ensure Safety and Provide a Safe Environment: The patient needs to feel secure and supported.\n- Provide Psychological First Aid: Offer empathy, reassurance, and validation. Reassure them that the assault was not their fault.\n\nPreserve Evidence (Forensic Priority):\n- Instruct the patient not to wash, douche, or change clothes.\n- If clothes were changed, they should be brought to the hospital in a paper bag (not plastic, to prevent moisture from degrading evidence).\n- Explain the importance of the forensic exam clearly and obtain informed consent. The patient has the right to refuse any part of the examination.\n\n- Offer Prophylaxis: Provide post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for HIV, emergency contraception, and prophylactic antibiotics for other STIs.\n- Documentation: Meticulously and objectively document all findings, injuries, and the patient's account using their own words in quotes.\n- Referral and Follow-up: Connect the patient with counseling services, support groups, and legal aid.\n\nPOSSIBLE NCK QUESTIONS:\n- What is the primary reason for instructing a sexual assault survivor not to bathe before a forensic exam? (Answer: To preserve physical and DNA evidence).\n- A nurse is collecting clothing from a sexual assault victim to be used as evidence. The clothing should be placed in what type of container? (Answer: A paper bag)."

    "question": "The right to determine one's own destiny is to autonomy as the duty to benefit or promote the good of others is to;",
    "options": {
      "A": "Nonmaleficence",
      "B": "Justice",
      "C": "Veracity",
      "D": "Beneficence"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Why D is correct: This question uses an analogy to define two core ethical principles.\n\nThe first part, 'The right to determine one's own destiny,' is the definition of Autonomy.\n\nThe second part, 'the duty to benefit or promote the good of others,' is the definition of Beneficence. Beneficence is the principle that obligates healthcare professionals to act for the benefit of their patients, to do good, and to promote their welfare.\n\nWhy the others are incorrect:\n\nA. Nonmaleficence: This is the duty to 'do no harm.' It is about avoiding actions that could cause harm to the patient. While related to beneficence, it is a separate principle focused on avoidance of harm rather than promotion of good.\n\nB. Justice: This refers to the principle of fairness, especially in the distribution of resources and care. It is about treating similar cases similarly.\n\nC. Veracity: This is the principle of truthfulness and honesty in dealing with patients.",
    "additional": "The Core Principles of Biomedical Ethics:\n\n| Principle      | Definition                                      | Nursing Application                                                                                 |\n|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Autonomy      | Respect for a person's right to self-determination. | Informed Consent: Ensuring a patient has all the information to make their own decision about treatment. |\n| Beneficence   | The duty to do good and promote the patient's welfare. | Providing a vaccination, educating a patient on healthy habits, providing comfort to a dying patient. |\n| Nonmaleficence| The duty to avoid causing harm ('do no harm').    | Checking for correct medication dosage to avoid an overdose, implementing fall prevention strategies. |\n| Justice       | The duty to be fair and treat like cases alike.  | Allocating resources (like ICU beds or organs for transplant) fairly, providing equal care regardless of patient's background. |\n| Fidelity      | The duty to be faithful to commitments and promises. | Following through on a promise to return with pain medication, maintaining confidentiality.          |\n| Veracity      | The duty to be truthful.                         | Providing honest and complete information to the patient about their condition and treatment, even if the news is bad. |\n\nPOSSIBLE NCK QUESTIONS:\n- A nurse carefully checks the 'five rights' of medication administration before giving a drug. This action primarily upholds which ethical principle? (Answer: Nonmaleficence).\n- When a nurse ensures that a patient fully understands the risks and benefits of a surgical procedure before signing the consent form, the nurse is upholding which ethical principle? (Answer: Autonomy)."
